We have a pretty good relationship. She came over to my place last night and we cooked dinner together. We have done that quite often since I moved close to her. One thing I don\u2019t like about her is her constant bitching about inconsequential matters. I have always just listened to her bitching because I know she just needs an ear, but today I had enough. While we were cooking, she bitched about the following things. Most of them are recurring complaints. She said her hair is so damaged because she has to get her hair bleached and dyed all the time since she\u2019s a model and doesn\u2019t get to have much control over her style. She even had the gall to bitch about her boobs killing her back even though she\u2019s the one who wanted implants. She also bitched about the traffic on the way here. It\u2019s LA. Traffic is a given. My breaking point was when she bitched about her boyfriend not returning her calls.\r\n\r\n\r\nI told her she has it easy and she really needs to stop bitching and bringing everyone else around her down. She asked me why she had it easy. I told her she lucked out being born a pretty girl and never having to do anything besides posing in front of cameras and being lucky enough to snag a rich boyfriend who she can live off and never have to work again after she gets married to him. I told her she doesn\u2019t hear me bitching even though I work a soul-sucking office job with ugly female coworkers for 60 hours a week to make pennies.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe asked me if I think it\u2019s easy for her because she\u2019s a woman. I told her many women have it tough, but she has it easy because she was dealt the right cards and she should really be grateful instead of complaining all the time. She said her life isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows and she has to face nonstop harassment and her relationships are often skin-deep because no one can see past her outer appearance. I said she must be joking because 99% of people would trade lives with her in a heartbeat if these little things are worth complaining about. She said everyone has a right to bitch about things to relieve tension and I can bitch to her about my life to her as well. I said it\u2019s not necessary and she should really cool it with the bitching because it makes her look like a child and kills the mood. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe said she\u2019ll try to bitch less, but said again she doesn\u2019t have it easy and her life is every bit as hard as mine. She said she\u2019s jealous of me being more than a piece of meat to most people and not having to be on guard 24/7. I told her to stop comparing and just enjoy what we have. She said I was right, but said again she doesn\u2019t have it easy and wants me to remember that. I was done with that crap. I didn\u2019t entertain that discussion anymore. She even bitched about the dish being too salty after we already agreed that it was perfect before turning off the stove. I rolled my eyes.

I'd just like to hear other people's opinions on this. My (31M) friend Hanna (31F) wanted to go out for her birthday Friday night for drinks and dancing. Our mutual friend Dana (30F) would be joining us as well. Couple random facts about me which come into play later, I'm gay and introverted. Doing anything like this is far out of my comfort zone but as it is my friend's birthday I thought I'd make an exception. \r\n\r\nWe all decided it would be best to do some pre-drinking at my place then head out to a club we've been to before for some fun. It was BYOB, Dana brought the cake, I brought the snacks. I got the Uber to the club. We get there and everything goes fantastically. Around 2am I get tired and tell them both alright I think I'd like to call it a night now but no, Dana was not having it. Dana wanted to go to another club nearby because she wants to see what the guys there are like and I'm pretty sure she just wanted to get laid. I said no again, I'm just really not feeling it now I'd like to go to sleep, and I would probably just be a cock block to these girls anyway if I'm dancing with them. Hanna says it's up to you but Dana absolutely insisted that I must come! So we all go and to my surprise when we walk into the club the bouncer stops me and says as a guy I must pay $10 cover to get in. The last club I went to (both straight clubs) had no cover charge. It was cash only and I had no money left from the last club so Dana says it's okay I'll get it you pay me back later.\r\n\r\nHere's where I maybe TA... I say fine but in my head I'm thinking I have no intentions on paying back Dana. It has nothing to do with the money whatsoever, it's the principal that I'm only here because she insisted I come here. They're looking for guys, this silly cover charge is to get more girls into the club's for free and... It's not like I'm going to run into any gay guys here so I don't see any reason for me to pay her back, she'll probably forget anyways.\r\n\r\nA few days past and Dana is asking me to pay her back, but I'm trying to dodge her.

Like every private school, it has its costs, and so, I am living with my Dad (64 y/o). Everything is going \\*well\\*, we had a few disputes, but generally it doesn't last long and after a few days, everything is back to normal.   \r\nBefore my Mom(61) moved, they were divorced BUT lived really near each other (like 200 meters away), so it was quite nice to change appartments everytime I want. So Mom moved, I stayed with my dad because I had all my friends and my school for the years to come. We all know that building a relationship when you're a 60+ Male is quite hard, and it's been 2 or more years that my dad was alone in his sentimental life.  \r\nIn August 2019, he went home with a woman, after a night of dancing and, obviously, they had sex. At first I did not bother, and it was a bit funny for me, because after all this time of being alone, he finally brought a girl home. August in France is holiday, so hearing him making noises at night is not annoying, because either it was the beginning of their relationships, either I was sleeping at a friend's house or somewhere else. Also, the women is very nice. She was always smiling, being kind, laughing.   \r\nAnyway, time is moving, and it's the time to return to school. That's when it started to bother me :  \r\nEvery weekend (from Friday night to Monday morning, so 3 nights) she stayed at the appartment. 3 nights per week, and they have sex almost every night. I told my dad at first, because it was a bit redundant. But it never stopped. And everynight I hear them. So after telling him, I throw a shoe at the wall. I giggled a bit because it was unusual and fun at first. But again, 2 months after, it never stopped. I told him many times to stop it. Just do it in the middle of the day, that's what I ask, but not at night.  \r\nSo, yesterday was enough.  \r\nI was at my sister's place for the weekend (1h30 of driving to return home), and went back hom sunday at 7pm approximately. From 7pm to 11pm, they did nothing sexual. Just eat, read, talk etc... But when I went to sleep (roughly 11.30pm), they started. I was so tired, and so angry that after all this time of telling him he's still doing it. So I stormed into his room, screaming that I had enough of his bullsh\\*t and that he should stop this immediatly.  \r\nI couldn't go into a big argument because it was late in the night and people are usually at 11pm.  \r\nI hope you all get the point, so reddit : AITA?"}, "5": {"id": "b2emwr", "title": "WIBTA if I broke up with my boyfriend because I realized I had feelings for someone else?", "body": "I posted this in r/relationship_advice too.\r\n\r\nI (24F) and my bf (24M) had been dating casually since about September, and in December I decided that we should become exclusive because 1) I wasn\u2019t seeing anyone else at the time 2) it felt like we were already in an exclusive relationship anyway 3) I didn\u2019t know how to introduce him to friends and family.

Whilst doing this, I've had to sacrifice hours to assist her whenever she's had a mental breakdown. I never expect anything in return.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt just so happens that me and sophie live close together, but despite growing close together we didn't meet up for a long time. This is because Sophie has severe social anxiety and is scared of men in general. Despite this, Sophie goes to a biannual cosplay convention and told me she would be happy to go with me and my friends as a group. Me and Sophie met 1 year ago at this convention. \r\n\r\nAfter the convention I asked her if she would like to go out together more, and she said yes, and that I should invite her out every month or so. I invited her out for 11 months (once a month) and each time Sophie declined my invitation. \r\n\r\nLast Month was the bi annual cosplay. I asked Sophie if she wanted to go but she said she found a cosplay group to go with, these are complete strangers and whilst she uncomfortable around people she is somehow able to tolerate being in a group of 30 people. I then asked Sophie if we could meet on the day, since I was also going to the convention, meeting her is very important to me, and it something I've told her many times, since I can only meet her at best 2 times a year. She told me that she didn't want to meet me (as in set a time/location), as she would feel like she has no control.

I was best friends with this girl for the first couple of years, but we had a falling out and are not on good terms at all. To make a looong story short, she has a bad history of twisting the truth to benefit her, gaslighting, and is in denial of her ability to do any wrong. When we were close, she was very open to me about her sexual activity, so I know she has a lot of partners and rarely uses protection.\r\n\r\nI recently found out through a mutual friend that she has herpes... and not like a potentially-false positive from an inaccurate blood test; she had an outbreak, was biopsied, and got her diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWhen she confided in my friend (who's also her closest friend), she basically said that she was just going to ignore it and hope she doesn't have another outbreak. I even have screenshots of her saying this. I don't know for sure that she's planning on not telling her future sexual partners or continuing to not use protection, but based on her past history and what she's said about the diagnosis, I suspect that's what she's going to do.\r\n\r\nThat scares me because we don't go to a very large school and our social circle is pretty small. Recently, there was a gonorrhea outbreak that got to a fairly large portion of my friends, so I've seen the way STIs spread here. I'm worried that it could come back to me or my friends since our sexual partners tend to overlap a bit and I know most, including myself, don't take precautions for STIs (rarely condoms, never dental dams/oral sex protection).\r\n\r\nSo my question is WIBTA if I were to tell someone about this? Obviously I have personal problems with this girl, but the last thing I want is to seem like I'm trying to be petty or get back at her. I'm genuinely just really concerned about the idea of an STI outbreak that stays with you forever. I was really glad that my friend told me as I was able to immediately get tested (negative) and I've already pledged to never have unprotected sex again. I just feel like the best way to get others to do the same is to tell them too.\r\n\r\nEdit: People have asked for info on who I would tell so I'll reiterate my reply to a comment here -- If I tell anyone it would be my close friends who I know have had overlapping sexual partners, especially since she doesn't know who gave it to her.

My (28F) sister (39F) is simultaneously the most generous and selfish person I know. For instance, when we used to live together, she would constantly bring home filet mignon and wine for dinner. I would already have my own dinner to eat (usually ramen or soup or some leftovers from the restaurant I work at, which I was actually more than happy to eat). But she would ALWAYS offer me a steak. I would refuse, but she wouldn't take no for an answer and we'd go back and forth 5 times until she insisted. I was always grateful and thanked her and enjoyed the steak. Then, 6 months later if we were arguing, she'd casually mention she's the one who \"always buys the filets\", and I'm always the one mooching off of her. EVEN WHEN I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE DAMN FILETS. I'm not as well off as she is. I say all of this to end with, she is one of my best friends and favorite people (aside from my husband), but we were not good roommates, lol.\r\n\r\nFast forward to today. She had abdominal surgery last week and hasn't been able to drive or go anywhere, but is otherwise fine. We had a small get together planned at the last minute at a close friend's house that she is willing to host at her house in order to be apart of it, which is awesome. I only just said I was going to be able to make it today. She texted all the invited parties in a group text a minute ago saying the following:\"Okay, I'm a bad host! I thought the pizzas in my fridge were gluten free \\[one of our friends has celiac\\] but they are not. I have 5 bottles of champagne, plenty of red wine, beer and lots of bourbon and vodka. I have food but it's soup and sandwiches and sick people stuff. :/ Can I just provide alcohol and fire and you guys bring some snacks?\"\r\n\r\nNow, I NEVER arrive to a party empty handed. My husband and I have an unopened bottle of bourbon we were planning on taking over and drinking, and since we are on a diet have dinner planned for ourselves ahead of time. This is how get togethers go in our friend group 100% of the time; the host provides food, we all bring drinks, so I wasn't prepared for an alternative. I have to work tonight and have a long awaited hair appointment tomorrow and I don't think I'll have time to throw together a gluten free dish for dinner, so I was going to just say \"husband and I are just going to eat dinner ahead of time, so don't worry about food for us. We'll bring our own drinks too!\" But I got to thinking of how tit-for-tat she is and started to worry that she'd be upset with me over it or call me selfish or lazy, or whatever. Sorry this is so long winded. Anyway, WIBTA if I didn't provide food for a party that she took over last minute by eating dinner ahead of time?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nINFO because I guess I didn't explain this well enough:\r\n\r\n* this is NOT a dinner party. I completely agree that showing up to a dinner party having already eaten dinner and not bringing food is tacky as hell. This is a drinking party/bonfire that will probably be at like 8 pm. All of our get togethers are drinking parties that the host provides small things like snacks for.\r\n* My sister does not live alone. Her boyfriend lives with her and he could just as easily go out and get small snacks for people to munch on, as is usually the case with our parties. I'm not sure why she hasn't asked him to do this yet, as nobody really ever \"eats\" at these parties, it's just an excuse for us to get together and have drinks and hang out.\r\n* I would gladly go out and bring chips and dip to keep the peace, but my sister will think that's tacky and would want something a little more extra than that, trust me I've known her as an adult and many of these moments have popped up in the past.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone making me see the error of my ways. \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m bringing food and my husband are cheating on our diet tonight. My sister actually texted separately without my intervention and said she knew about my diet and to not worry about bringing anything since she\u2019d figured we\u2019d want to stick to our meal plan, but we\u2019re bringing wings and everyone is happy.

For the sake of this post we will call her Chabby.  At first I was reluctant of getting into a relationship because of my current situation, but she however kept insisting that she was interested in me and wanted to get to know me. I thought it wouldnt be too bad to meet her level of commitment to this by reciprocating her feelings. Chabby and I eventually decided to meet, but before that, this is important, we video chatted a couple of times. During those video chats we would talk about random things and it would even escalate to point where we were strip teasing each other. Giving me the impression that she was sexually attracted to me. As for the place we would meet for our first \"date\" we couldnt figure out a place so I suggested the infamous \"netflix and chill. Now many people know what that actually means and to that manner I asked Chabby during one of many of our conversations if she wanted to have sex with me. To which she answered \"yeah if it happens it happen, but dont be expecting it.\" So the day we are supposed to meet finally comes which is a Saturday, however, she cancels because she was too tired from work which I understand so we reschedule for the next Saturday. Chabby and I met for the first time at her place. We head inside and to the promise of my end, I had brought some food to make for dinner for the both us, but Chabby had said she wasnt hungry, so we decided to watch a show on Netflix. Before actually watching the show. We decided to smoke some weed to which I suggested because she is an avid smoker and I thought it help with the tension of the situation. My mind was a mess and my ability to think rationally was completely hindered. Im not too sure if it was because of the weed, but I manipulated her to getting into bed with me and made sexual advances on her. To which she was strongly against so I did not proceed any further. I apologized about it and we spent the rest of the night watching Netflix, talking, and eating the meal I had prepared for the both of us. Eventually we went our seperate ways. The day after, ridden by such regret and dissappointment, I suggested we stop talking and remain as friends. To which she agreed that is what she thought as well. However my dumb ass changed my mind and asked for one more chance by explaining that I was not in the right mind and just wanting to be friends was a result of that. In response of that, Chabby said told me how disrespectful I was and how to how ordeal of me making advances made her extremely uncomfortable and proceeded to call me a creep and then blocked me from contacting her in any way.

I was his roommate in college. He met this girl, Kelly, during our freshman year and they began dating. Being Mason\u2019s roommate and friend, I became close with Kelly too. They stayed together throughout all 4 years of college and continued dating after graduation. Super cute couple. Was proud of them in a weird way.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, we all got jobs in the same city and lived near each other. One day, Kelly (22 at the time), confided in me and basically said that while she liked Mason a lot, she was less happy than before, and wasn\u2019t sure if she should be tied down so young. Kelly talked through her feelings with me, and concluded that she was going to break up with Mason. Meanwhile, Mason told me a week prior that he\u2019s never been happier and was even thinking of proposing. I told Kelly this during our chat and she made her decision with this in mind.\r\n\r\nI sat around fearing the pending fallout between my two close friends when I received horrible news. As you saw coming from the title of this post, Kelly never got the chance to tell Mason how she felt. She died in a car accident the same day she told me her decision to dump Mason.\r\n\r\nMason grieved, and grieved hard. I never told him about me and Kelly\u2019s convo. Two years later and after lots of therapy and such, he\u2019s much better, though far from perfect. Nowadays, Mason tells me that he\u2019s discovered that love is the most important thing to him in life and that he aspires to marry. He tried dating over the past half year, but always ends up saying that \u201cI\u2019m confident that no girl will ever love me the same way Kelly did. This is pointless.\u201d At this point, he\u2019s pretty much given up on dating and is becoming more depressed.\r\n\r\nBy now I think you can sense my dilemma: should I tell Mason about Kelly and I\u2019s conversation? Maybe it\u2019ll help him realize he can find a better match for himself and that his views on his old relationship are romanticized and not good for his future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m not sure if it will make much of a difference other than me breaking his heart even further and harming his grieving process. Maybe it would be better off to just let him continue the hard work he\u2019s put in to heal so far and let him continue his healing without my interference. I\u2019m also not sure what it will do to our friendship: I\u2019ve sat on this info for a long ass time now. \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I told him???\r\n\r\nEdit: just for clarity due to some comments, it\u2019s not like dropping this would be the first thing I tried to help him.

The first time I met her was at a family event of his, I was myself all evening and tried to get to know her more but she was cold and short with me. His sister told me not to worry she's just very shy. The event had live music and I ended up dancing with one of his brothers and since we were drinking we all got an uber back to his family's house and his sister and I made a joke that the little brother is a much better dancer than Joe and GF apparently took exception to that. Since then he has been distant with me. When they got engaged I messaged Joe and his wife to congratulate them. She said, \"thank you but you're not invited to the wedding cause we are keeping it small\". That hurt but I figured it's your wedding do what you want. Joe and I didn't talk much last year, but I thought nothing of it because I was busy and so was he with the wedding. I get that friendships change and sometimes stop over time.

I got a bunch of gifs in response like Homer Simpson saying \"go away you jerk\", Jeffree Star laughing and saying \"you thought\", a few \"bye bitch\" \"Not today Satan\" and something that said you were never my friend! It really hurt and so I reached out to the brother to see what was going on- the new wife is crazy. She likes his hair a certain way and has forbidden him from cutting it a different way. She was rude to his whole extended family and was overheard saying at the wedding \"I wish I didn't have to invite all of these people- they are taking up space\". She monitors all of Joe's social media and unfollowed/ blocked a ton of women.  He had to ask for a resignment at work so he didn't have to work one on one with women.

On one hand I don't want to push boundaries and make him uncomfortable, I really want to respect that straight guys can have gay friends and it doesn't always need to be sexual.

I\u2019ve talked about doing this before (not as a b-day gift) and she likes the idea, but I\u2019m not sure if it would be selfish or not because it would be a tattoo on me. I keep thinking of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer gets Marge the bowling ball for her birthday. \r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t very clear on \u201cneed\u201d. We both enjoy a child free lifestyle and with that comes disposable income, so it\u2019s not uncommon for me to take her out to dinner or splurge at the mall on a whim.  Most of our gifts now are things we need or things the house needs because we surprise each other with things on regular days."}, "28": {"id": "dk98z8", "title": "AITA for being mad at my boyfriend (28m) for leaving me (31f) at one of his friend\u2019s weddings by myself so he could talk to other people", "body": "My boyfriend was in a wedding party for one of his friends. Leading up to the event,  I met a few of his friends once or twice in the 1.5 years we\u2019ve been together and have gotten on fairly well with the friends. I met the bride and groom twice and also helped them move apartments so was happy to celebrate their wedding with them once I got invited. However, I should mention that the wedding was on a Friday, so for me to come to the wedding I had to take a vacation day from work. Also, I wouldn\u2019t have been sitting with the wedding party but instead got sat with some old childhood friends of my boyfriend\u2019s and the groom\u2019s. Before I made the decision to go, I knew going into the wedding that I wasn\u2019t going to see him much during the first half of the day because of his groomsman duties, but I told him that if he wanted me there I would make an effort to be there and take the vacation day. He said he\u2019d like me there so I went.\r\n\r\nSo at the wedding, boyfriend barely spends any time at all with me. Even after dinner, he spends his time circulating the room and talking with other people, drinking heavily with other friends, and doesn\u2019t really keep track of where I am in the room. I got to know some of his friends better during dinner which was great, however I still felt frustrated seeing some of the other groomsmen go back for their (also solo-sitting) dates and introduce them to friends, and consciously making an effort to enjoy the night with their dates while at the same time just seeing him just doing his own thing. We did take one photo together before dinner, and have one drink together, but the rest of the evening he would run away to talk to other people, and then later if I ran into those people and introduced myself without boyfriend there, they\u2019d say \u2018oh we know who you are, it\u2019s so weird that (boyfriend) didn\u2019t introduce us\u2019. Essentially he didn\u2019t keep track of where I was basically all night, to the point where his friends that would ask ME where he was. I was pretty embarrassed that I didn\u2019t know and that he was obviously leaving me with them to go off and socialize without me. Another moment in the night was where I was dancing by myself (ie with guests I did not talk to yet, but without people I knew) on the dance floor to a song I really liked, and I saw that he saw me from across the room but instead of coming over to me he left the room with some friends. I was pretty hurt at this. But I still had a good time because the alcohol was flowing and the people were great.\r\n\r\nSo Reddit, am I an asshole to expect that my boyfriend spend more time with me at this wedding? \r\n\r\nI should note that I did ask him just after dinner to spend more time with me but he didn\u2019t really come back to spend time together until the dance floor was going, and even then he was more in it for his friends than me. We did not fight or argue before this wedding and he was not angry at me as far as I know, and he\u2019s acted this way at other friends\u2019 weddings but to a lesser extent.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I want to clarify - my expectation was never that he spend the whole wedding with me, and his duties as a groomsman ended after dinner. I came to the wedding knowing I wouldn't see him for at least half the day and ready to make friends on my own, and I did! I made an effort to mingle and get to know people and that's why the event ended up being fun. I was not able to keep up with where he was in the room as I was also socializing, but I was hurt that he made a very small effort to spend time with me as his date, though he told me that he would like to have me there."}, "29": {"id": "ame5ld", "title": "AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for watching porn?", "body": "It's more complicated than the title.

I asked for the same thing for Christmas and have asked for this every year on my bday and Christmas. I also ask that my parents both be there for random things, like when I had surgery or when I was hospitalized with the flu a few years ago.

While my parents didn't stay together they stayed on good terms for my sake, there has never really been any bitterness or fighting between them. I was raised mainly by my mum and her parents, but saw my dad regularly growing up. Due to this my dad was able to do things my mum wasn't, such as go to university, get a good but demanding job and really progress in his career. He earns a decent wage and has always been very generous towards me and my mum.\r\n\r\n A few years ago my dad got a new girlfriend who we will call Kim. From the offset Kim didn't really make an effort with me (my dad has had one serious girlfriend before Kim who I liked and always made a big effort with me), and who I feel has always viewed me as an inconvenience, however she never said or did anything specific that I could pinpoint. She basically just ignores me besides basic formalities and always seems bored or annoyed when I'm around, and always has a face on whenever my dad gives me any attention. Kim and my dad got married a year ago, I was a bit gutted as mine and Kim's relationship isn't in a great place but I always tried to never let it show. Anyway, Kim is a bit younger than my dad and I had always assumed they might have kids of their own one day and sure enough recently my dad told me that I am going to be a big sister (my mum never had any more kids). I was happy for my dad and didn't feel any resentment or jealousy as I am an adult and have my own life, I was genuinely really pleased for my dad as he seemed so excited. That was until my Aunty (dad's sister) sent me a screen shot of a status Kim had posted as I don't have her on Facebook. It basically said \"So happy to announce that me and (my dad) are having a baby! I couldn't be more excited to be having my first child with the man of my dreams and we are both so excited to start a real family!\"\r\n\r\n When I saw the post I felt like I had been winded, to me it felt like she was saying that I was not\" real family\" to my dad and that this new child will be my dad's first \"real child\". That day I text my dad and said that I'm sorry I wasn't \"real enough family\" for him but don't worry as he won't ever have to speak to me again. He rang me like 4 times in a row but I didn't pick up. He left me a message asking me to ring him back. I was furious at the time but it's been 2 weeks since and I have calmed down enough to the point where I feel like I could talk to him now, however he hasn't tried to contact me since and my aunt confirmed the post is still up on Facebook for all to see. My mum thinks that my dad is just giving me space and that I should contact him if I feel ready to talk to him, however in my head the fact that he hasn't contacted me since confirms in my head that the post is true and my dad doesn't view me as his real family, AITA for not making contact with him?"}, "33": {"id": "eh2rwu", "title": "AITA for no telling my SO that I will no longer join his family get-togethers if his mother is there?", "body": "My SO (40M) and I (48F) have been together for 11 years.

In fact, two call him \u201cDad\u201d because their bio-father has cut them out of his life for not following his beliefs.\r\n\r\nI also discussed with him about having biological children: whether he was interested or not. I was not getting younger and we needed to make a decision before time ran out. Again without hesitation, he would always say that he has 3 kids, why would we have more? He even considered a vasectomy to make it easier on us but for a long time, we just couldn\u2019t afford it.\r\n\r\nHis mother (whom I will call MiL for short), hinted for several years at how she wanted to be a grandmother.

The beginning of our relationship wasn\u2019t that great, we argued a lot but somehow couldn\u2019t seem to end it. After about a year, things went slowly but steadily better and I thought we were in a pretty good spot this year. During the summer, I got put on a work project in a different city for three months, where, due to project deadlines, I couldn\u2019t come back every weekend.

The other message was from a new Facebook friend, from the sounds of it someone he met at a friends wedding in July where I couldn\u2019t come due to work. They where chatting and she asked him if he wanted to join her for a New Year\u2019s Eve Party in our city. Apparently she was currently going alone. He replied he didn\u2019t want to commit to anything on New Year\u2019s Eve yet but indicating the party sounded good.

Happened 3 months ago, land of the free in a medium size town. \r\n\r\nI (m 38) work as a dentist assistant. Worked the same place for 14 years, pay and work has been pretty nice for the last 13, before new owner came into our lives around 1 year ago. \r\n\r\nThis is the biggest dentists office in town, really no competition. 4 dentists, 2 secretaries, 2 dentist assistants. Boss is the 5th dentist. \r\n\r\nWork environment have for a long time been cordial and nice. We are having lunch breaks together, and every 4 months or so a really nice barbeque with colleagues and their SO's. Really chill vibes.\r\n\r\nInitially the new owner seemed nice, really positive and what at first i viewed as flirty in a charming \"old guy\" way (he is around 60, silver fox long hair, slim and tall, james bond kind of guy - i am not in love with this guy as i am happily married with 2 kids, but you know the kind of guy even texans could find charismatic). \r\n\r\nSo first 4 months runs smoothly from what i can see. 5th month, im starting to see patients coming out of this guy's office in minor distress (somewhat red faces, avoiding eye contact, at one point almost tearing up). Hard to notice at first, but one of the secretaries makes me aware of it, and then it is unavoidable to see. One of the old timers came out very angry, confided to one of the secretaries that \"this guy have serious attitude problems\". Turns out he had been really demeaning to the guy (sighing during work-up, rolling his eyes when asked questions, seemingly acting like the customers problems were ridiculous). I had a hard time taking the customer seriously, as he was basically fuming and ive seen my share of high demanding pricks trough my days. This happened multiple times through the months, most patients just didnt want to talk about it (a lot of these patients speek poorly english). \r\n\r\nOne day one of the secretaries tells me she has increasing amount of phone calls of people wondering about high bills. Turns out mister boss man is the one generating the higher bills. He does this in not an exactly illegal way, but highly unethical: he adds the most expencive materials (for the customer, not for the office - because of patents vs generica), he xrays the shit out of everything altough not called for, and so on. He is sweeping in probably per month around 3-4000 bucks this way, while really not adding to the treatment or his own costs. The customer takes the bill. \r\n\r\nSo a while back i came in from the kitchen as i see this guy is brushing into one of the secretaries asses. The secretary is a quite young girl new to the office, around 26 years old. He notices me and just stride along smiling, as nothing ever happened. The secretary is standing stiff looking bothered, her eyes down. I ask what's up, and she just breaks down in tears (luckily no patients in the waiting room). Turns out this guy has been making aproaches for weeks. She had told him she was happily in a relationship, but he didnt let of and had basically been saying 'good luck on getting another job here without moving out of state'. She didnt know what to do as she has not a lot of education and is really depending on a good reference if she were to move. \r\n\r\nThis shit pissed my right of. This guy have thrown this office out of ballance. However, he is the owner, and new owners in this part of the country is hard to come by. Legal actions against this guy would and should be taken, but the truth is it will fuck all of us up in some way or another.\r\n\r\nNext days my passive anger kept on growing, and one night i snuck up to this guys house and keyed some good and deep fucking ripples into the door of this guys smooth ass black 2000's porsche 911 turbo. \r\n\r\nBossman came in red and flustered to the office the next day, couldnt stop talking of how shitty this town is and that he should have never come here in the first place. Got his car sprayed decently fast, and now its starting to chill down again.\r\n\r\nSo, am i the asshole here? I guess i am an asshole for not calling him out, but small waves here would have disastrous consequences not only for me. I am tempted to repeating this in some way.

This is because a lot of people, especially during their teenage years, have no idea what they want or what type of people they're attracted to. Sometimes people take the time to reflect/introspect and do truly know what they want, but most in my experience don't. That leads to people saying stuff that usually ends up being widely inaccurate. Therefore, it's their actions- who they're attracted to/date, who they dislike/aren't attracted to, the way they act around you, etc that you have to watch to get a good picture of them.

I have become quite a lot fitter over the course of our relationship, and feel great about it and myself, and it causes me to feel isolated from him in that regard.. \r\n\r\nHe does not seem to care particularly about his health, which does bother me(somewhat increasingly), as I don't want to longterm be with someone that can't bother to show up for themself and take care of their health. For one thing, if he lost weight I suspect his snoring would decrease (the main deterrent to me staying over more, so if nothing else, I feel that should be a motivator?). \r\n\r\nI feel like maybe leaving a scale, you know, for me to use..

The collection as it stands now has roughly 190 games (all still in their box - we had a rule that anything not in its appropriate container/space would be trashed), several accessories (powerpad etc), and a big sack of (probably worthless) nintendo power magazines.\r\n\r\nWhen I left for college, we decided that I would keep it all, because my parents didn't want it taking up so much space in our old rooms, and I've had it ever since.  I am starting to feel the same as my parents - it takes up an entire bookcase and some closet space for the accessories and consoles, and have floated the idea of selling it many times over the past 6-7 years, only to be shot down every time.  I have also asked my siblings if they'd be interested in taking it, but they always say they have no room, maybe in a few months, etc, always an excuse.  It has been at least 5 years since anyone, including me has actually played these things.  My argument has always been that the value is only going to go down in the future - there will always be people who like \"retro\" games, but people who will pay a premium for the boxes and stuff?  I doubt it - everyone seems to be moving more toward ROMs, or just loose cartridges and don't care at all about the box.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I tried one more time, and this is where I think I may have been an AH.  After they said they didn't want it, I started shopping it around without telling them, because I knew telling them would start a huge fight.  I got in touch with another collector and I said I was going to just sell it all at once (knowing I wouldn't be getting full market value - I didn't want to spend years piecing it out), and he put me in touch with a guy who made a fairly reasonable offer I tentatively agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe problem is I let it slip to my parents that I was doing it (I am overly chatty when i'm drunk), so of course despite promising not to tell my siblings, I've now been getting bombarded with angry messages from them, saying I am killing their \"childhood\", I have no right, even a threat of legal action, etc.  I ended up calling the potential sale off for now, but I feel like I should still be able to sell this stuff.  I should note that even after they found out I was serious about selling it, they still won't take custody of it. I am far from a lawyer, but I'd have to imagine at some point family property becomes my property after so many years of unsuccessfully trying to unload it on them and it taking up my space.

Blocking out the outside world. Up until \\~9 months ago, that would be via headphones, which make it obvious to people that I am listening to music.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nBut now I have these fancy new hearing aids that basically make me a cyborg. I can stream anything from my phone directly into my hearing aids. I love it; not having to carry around headphones anymore is just so convenient. It does make the hearing aid batteries die much faster, but it's worth it.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the problem... I always pause the music when initiating interactions in public. Examples: going into a store (I'll pause the whole time I'm in the store), getting on the bus (in case the driver has something to say as I pass by after swiping). Outside of things like that, I keep it going constantly.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI live in a busy metro area, and random people try to talk to me pretty often. Usually to ask for money or a cigarette (I do smoke). It is a particular pet peeve of mine when strangers ask for a cigarette; culturally (in the US anyway) they're somehow frequently seen as communal property and among friends, I get that. I will give any friend a cigarette anytime. But not a stranger, and even more annoying than being asked 5 - 10 times a day (NOT exaggerating) is that half the time (again NOT exaggerating) the reaction when I say \"no\" is quite negative, with a sense of entitlement that just pisses me off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow I have noticed in the last 9 months that people have been trying to talk to me and I frequently don't realize it until I am past them and they are yelling. In general, even though I'm annoyed at what they're asking, and I don't feel I owe them a cigarette, I do feel that as humans they deserve a reply rather than being ignored. If I realize someone is talking to me before I pass them, I will generally say \"can't help you\" because I don't know what they're actually saying, as I have the music going. This answers any query and allows me to keep walking. To be \"more\" polite, I'd have to ask them to hold on, pause the music, ask them to repeat themselves, then say \"no.\"\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo my question is about the scenario where I don't hear them and appear to completely ignore them.

Anyway, the story is this. She and I were really close. Like, text each other every day for a few years now close. We knew everything about each other and any time we had a problem, we could talk it out. Now, we have a problem. She got close to a guy over the summer and she seems like she has feelings for him. Truth be told, I hate this guy, and I\u2019m 95% sure that any romance between them would not last. She acts like an entirely different person when she\u2019s around him, and seems to want to spend as much time with him as possible. Typical high school crush fare, right? The issue is, she\u2019s slowly phasing me and some of her other mutual friends out of her life to be around him. I\u2019ve told her many times that this is upsetting me and that we need to talk about it, to no avail. Recently, we had a sort of \u201cfree day\u201d where we could chill with our whole grade, and you\u2019d think she didn\u2019t even know my name. After the fact, I sent her the obligatory \u201cwe need to talk\u201d text, she left me on read, and I guess it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I admittedly got more frustrated than I should\u2019ve. I texted her, and I quote, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna assume you didn\u2019t have time to answer so I don\u2019t get really pissed off rn,\u201d and I was being genuine.

I really don\u2019t want to lose her friendship, and I know it must be hard for her that I really dislike this guy. Regardless, I don\u2019t think I deserved to be blocked when all I wanted to do was talk it out.

I initially wanted to join to give myself purpose and structure, but decided to try college instead. I ended up working full time through college to avoid student debt, and thanks to the help and support of my wife (24 F), graduated with a bachelor's degree.  Since I have graduated, I have started my career, we've had a son (7 mos) and have been struggling with the increased financial burden that brings on. After some budgeting judo, we are able to make all of our payments, and even get to splurge on a nice date every once in a while.  \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, our stress levels are pretty high right now with the more restrictive budget and the challenges that being new parents brings.  Though, I have to admit, our son is amazing and as far as babies go, incredibly low maintenance. \r\n\r\nWhen I graduated college, I spent a lot of time looking for jobs, and brought up active duty military as an option. It started a fight between my wife and me.  Since that time, we have quarrelled over military service, with both of us trying to convince the other to change their mind. She initially wanted me just to forget about the military, saying that when we got married I never brought up anything about military and this is not what she signed up for when we got married.  I do now agree that active military is not a good fit for our lives, and brought up the idea of serving in the reserves or national guard so I could live locally while still serving and fulfilling my desire.\r\n\r\nNow she is telling me that she is concerned that our marriage would not survive basic training because it would be too much separation (8-9 weeks) and she lays out her concerns -1. She would be worried about me cheating on her during basic, even though I have never cheated on her or any other partner I have ever had. 2. Our son will not recognize me after such a long period apart. 3. I will remember what it is like to not be tied down by a wife and child and will want a divorce. 4. She will have more duties taking care of our dogs and house while I am away. 5. What if I am deployed? 6. I would be signing my life away for the amount of time I would be enlisted. \r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that joining the air national guard would benefit our family by providing better health insurance (we currently have some weird health cost sharing thing) and additional income, while being relatively low impact on our lives, outside of the initial basic training and potential for deployment."}, "71": {"id": "b2qa12", "title": "AITA for wanting to bring another girl with my girlfriend and me to prom?", "body": "My girlfriend (18 F) and I (17 M) have been dating for close to a year now.

I do support their relationship. My sister and I were also on good terms our entire lives and have been pretty close.\r\n\r\nWell around 2 saturdays back my sister decided it was a good idea to let the three of us and two other of her friends meet for dinner. Before that, she told me a thousand times to not be awkward and to talk. Aditionally, I am always very irritable on Saturdays (today is one) for a reason, she knows why. So fast forward to when I see him, at first it was just really awkward and I didn't know how to act. Considering our 5-year gap, I thought it would be fine to subtly play the role of the annoying younger sister. At first to break the silence I said stuff like \"you two should hold hands\" a couple times. And he was fine. After a while, he started talking to me in a very sarcastic tone saying stuff like, \"Math is very fun\" for example, knowing clearly that I hated math to the core. He was just very jokingly sarcastic and that offended me. Usually I would be able to take it, but I was already feeling quite done that day. Besides, it conveyed so much condescension. Attacking my weak spots like that made it feel like he was mocking me. I proceeded to say \"My parents talk about you a lot. But don't worry, they didn't say anything bad. Even if they did, I wouldn't tell you.\" That was said in a VERY joking tone as well. Honestly, that was a way to get back at him and stop his remarks at the same time. During the dinner, he complained there was a high pitched sound and stood outside for the rest of the time. My sister then said that she wasn't hungry either, and left to be with him. When I went out afterwards, she told me to leave.\r\n\r\nWhen she got home, she lashed out at me saying I made him uncomfortable and all. She highlighted in particular what I said about my parents, and said I shouldn't have joked about it if I didn't know what he was like. After that, she refused to talk to me for 3 whole days. We share a room. Now everytime we come anywhere near the topic she gets angry. She also said that he doesn't like me and it's my fault for making myself so unlikable. I find it absolutely ridiculous that now she acts like an inconsiderate roommate. Everytime I talk to her when she's texting him she completely brushes off what I say with \"ok\". When I repeat myself, she starts to get angry. When she isn't talking to him, she's very moody. \r\n\r\nI feel like reaching out to apologise is only gonna make him scorn. I don't care if he hates me or not, but I think it's starting to get in the way of my sister's and my relationship. She has already been acting like that before that dinner, and all the dinner has done for us is make her start being hostile towards me. \r\n\r\nSo, AITA for not wanting to be the one to apologise to him and try and fix our relationship?

My main issue with this is simple- My niece is 12, and isn't the most responsible kid in the world (I mean, she's a kid), and my sister is often too busy to notice the small stuff, and I am concerned that the piercing will not be taken care of properly, get infected and cause a bunch of health, cosmetic and financial issues.

My niece has also had ear piercings before, and has had to get them looked at and re-done because of lack of care (minor infections and the piercings closing over a lot).\r\n\r\nI also really think she's simply too young for a belly button piercing, and may invite attention from the wrong kind of people.

I am fully aware that at the end of the day, I am not the parent, my sister has the right to allow her kids to do whatever she thinks is right and that my sister and my niece are both in charge of their own lives, and the last thing I want is to create another rift in my family, however I really think they are making dumb decisions without thinking about any consequence.

Let's call it three to four times a week. My bf's roommate (Fred, 35m) thinks I am staying there too often and loath's my presence. This culminated in a huge argument between Fred and Chris, and they have only recently patched things up, now with a \"no guests period\" rule at their apartment.\r\n\r\nMy BF and I knew each other for about 6 months, but had very recently started dating when all this started. My apartment had a serious mold problem to the point that I could not sleep there anymore, so I swapped apartments, but had about a month to blow before the new lease kicked in. I was crashing on friend's couches, etc. Chris on the other hand, had a really nice bed and roommate situation, so I admit sleeping there pretty often until I got my new apartment. Chris and his roommate had alternate schedules, where Fred worked until 4am and Chris worked mornings, so if I came over to sleep he would not even be there, and I would quietly leave with Chris in the early AM. I did not come during the day when Fred was home and almost never saw him, except twice where I cooked dinner for everyone including him. I never ate any food that I did not bring to the house, and if I used a glass/pot/pan I would clean, dry and put it away. Utilities are included in their rent so I was not costing him any extra money if I took a shower. Also I get out of work at 10pm so I would go over there just to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe only way he would know that I was there were the plethora of cameras he had around the house that would alert his phone whenever someone was home or moving in different rooms. He watched the cameras when he was at work and starting telling Chris that I was over too often as a result. He is gay himself, so he has no qualms with a gay relationship, but had recently got out of a 3 month relationship and might possibly be jealous that his roommate is regularly getting some. He would have no way of knowing how often I am at the house without the cameras. He flipped out saying that I went into his room once (I would never) and refused to show the recorded video as proof. He merely asserted I was doing it and said that I was not welcome over again, despite both of them splitting rent and there being nothing in the lease about not having people over.\r\n\r\nEven so, over this three month period, Chris and I did three day sailing expeditions into the Caribbean five times, plus Chris had a 5 day vacation, an 8 day vacation, and a 4 day vacation and I had a 12 day vacation that did not overlap with Chris's, so of course I was not sleeping over during then. Point is there were periods when no one was around, even though when we were in town together I slept over most nights.\r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nedit: Haven't stayed in house since the \"no roommate\" rule.

She arrived on Wednesday. On Thursday we were having tea with my grandparents who invited us to welcome her. After tea we stayed at the table and had a chat. It was maybe 7.30 so not late at all when she apparently got really tired. She asked me of we could go home since she wanted to sleep. I told her not yet because my grandmother had backed a cake and it would be rude to leave before she served it. About 10 minutes later she put her head on my shoulder and FELL ASLEEP!! I woke her up and told her that we could leave soon as my grandmother was just getting the cake ready. Then we ate the cake and my girlfriend half fell asleep again with her head against the wall this time. We left shortly after and I told her that it was rude to fall asleep and my grandparents were really looking forward to this night and had put a lot of effort into food and dessert.

I have a boyfriend (35M) who is, *apparently*, much better at detecting homosexuals in the wild and recognizing flirting, and he happens to think I am an asshole.\r\n\r\nRecently, this guy moved to my city and our mutual friend thought it would be nice if I showed him around. I thought it would be awkward but turns out he's a pretty cool guy (let's call him Guy). Within a month, we went to a museum, to the theater, to a couple of concerts, and multiple dinners, one of which included my boyfriend.\r\n\r\nAfter that last dinner, my BF became convinced that Guy was into me. I said I thought you'd have to be out of your mind to flirt with another man right in front of his partner. Besides, I didn't even know if he was gay. My BF told me I was naive and blind and I said he was being silly. I don't want to say that we *fought*, because I feel like **he** fought, and **I** just kept dismissing everything he was saying, but yeah, we fought.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Guy texts me that he wants to see a concert and I ask my BF if that's ok, and since he's already pissed off, he just tells me to do whatever the fuck I want. So I go to the concert.\r\n\r\nEverything was fine, we had a few drinks, the music was great. Since it was very loud, every time we wanted to tell each other something, we had to get really close and shout in each other's ear. So after a few back and forths like this, he grabs my hand and pulls me in and I think he wants to tell me something. He comes in with his face from a weird angle and I pull away. Or try to, because he then puts his hand around my neck and goes in for a kiss. He didn't kiss me, I pulled away successfully this time, and I just left.\r\n\r\nI told my BF everything and he was incredibly angry with me and said I was an asshole. He's now upset with me and doesn't want to talk about it. I'm also 51% sure he cried last night. He hasn't looked me in the eye since then (to be fair, it's only been about 20 hours). I don't think that's fair at all. I think I'm an idiot but am I really an asshole? For not realizing some dude was into me? How was I supposed to know he was into me? I never once suspected he was, I never interpreted anything he said as flirtatious, he never touched me. I have no idea how my BF even realized that he was into me.\r\n\r\nAs for the second part of the title, my BF and I are supposed to have a romantic weekend away for Easter. In case he doesn't leave me in the next 7 days, I was going to propose to him. I already got the ring months ago, but I waited because I wanted it to be special.

No one in the family has really asked me in detail what type of women I like, until my cousin (26F) came to America to visit.

Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.\r\n\r\nSo my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly.

He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.\r\n\r\nDuring our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue. \r\n\r\nHowever, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. \r\n\r\nMy wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong.

So at said restaurant, we're having lunch and it is a SLOOOOW day for this place. Now I normally have absolutely zero issue with food coming out slow, it happens, I get it. But being one of 4 tables on an uncharacteristically slow day with a full staff, I shouldn't expect to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches that seemed like they'd been done for quite some time. The food was cold, soggy, unseasoned, and their new portion control ideas were taken WAY too far.

My (25M) girl (25F) and I have been together for 2 and a half years. She has a 8 year old son from her previous relationship. We just had a daughter in December of last year who's 9 months now. \r\n\r\nThere's a fair that comes to town for 2 weeks every year, always at this time. (Google Dixie Classic Fair)\r\n\r\nI've been looking forward to it for a multitude of reasons. One of them being seeing my daughter react to the petting zoo, all the animals they have, and getting to see some unique things. We take her to feed horses about once every 2 week because she's completely fascinated by animals. Even cats or rabbits so we knew large animals would impress her.\r\n\r\nI want to get to enjoy the fair one time with just the 3 of us.

It's not like I don't want to go with him, or don't think he should go. He's just so hyper, and is going to want to ride all the rides, which is awesome, and I can't wait to get to do that with him.

When it came to plans for dress and tux, my partner stated that he would like to wear his kilt during the ceremony and reception. I was really taken aback because although he does have Scottish heritage, from my perspective it's pretty distant (one parent on his mother's side) and no one from his immediate or extended family engage in Scottish traditions, live/have visited Scotland, ect. He became interested in his Scottish heritage in high school, and his great-aunt helped him research the family tartan and gave him the kilt as a graduation gift, custom made in Scotland.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, just because he identifies strongly with his Scottish heritage doesn't mean that it's appropriate to wear the kilt at the wedding, which is not in Scotland and has no Scottish connection other than his heritage. Very few of our friends and family members on my side even know that he is Scottish, so it's going to get a lot of looks and comments on the day of. He's only worn it twice in the four years we've been together. My parents already think he's eccentric and I know I'd never hear the end of it.

He was really hurt when I told him I'd rather him wear something a little more traditional. He also said the only argument I could make that makes sense to him is that I, as the bride, probably want the focus to be on me and how I look, and while like yeah, he's right on one level, I feel like that's not really the reason I don't want him to wear the kilt."}, "97": {"id": "bzqanz", "title": "AITA for asking a waiter what else he does?", "body": "I (F20) went on a date with a guy (M30).

A closet. Well me going into a closet while she was folding laundry. A little background: I used to be a HUGE gamer and now my PS4 is a certified Netflix mule to say the least, so with it being the holidays and my friends and myself all being home from work, we started a match. I was supposed to get a full day to game with my friends the previous day but ended up cooking and cleaning because she was tired. So I let her sleep.\r\n\r\n Admittedly, once I started playing I  became distracted by the match and didn't respond when she asked me to stand up from the bed and didn't look at a pair of my son's pants that she showed me but I only played for a total of 15 minutes and I was done. No biggie, right? So when I finish, I look over the laundry on the floor and notice a pair of my pants that I was looking for. I had planned to give my brother an Apple Watch for Christmas but had stupidly left it in the pants so I quickly picked them up and to my dismay noticed that the watch wasn't there. So I open the closet and look for the other pair of pants that I think it might be in. She starts complaining about me entering the closet even though she was nowhere near it at the time and I didn't mess up any of the folded clothes she had stacked. In fact, I took 30 seconds to find the new pants and retrieve the watch; all the while she's still complaining and now angry. I show her the watch and I am ecstatic that I found it and tell her \"See? I found it. You gotta stop being so controlling\". She gets super upset by this and I get upset that it was even an issue and the night ends with me cleaning the kitchen and her the bedroom before she falls asleep.\r\n\r\n The next day were having a sort of cold war about it and not really talking. She asks me am I going to apologize and I state \"I don't think I was wrong. Why do I have to apologize?' we drop it. And then she starts in about how the day (it was NYE) was going to be ruined now. Which I didn't see how since we had the entire day to resolve things before our plans. This leads to another argument and she starts yelling which I don't respond to in the slightest because I don't believe in yelling, so I sorta just occupy myself with my phone and don't engage other than a few words and this gets her very angry. She begins a tirade about my ex, her ex who was a drug addict but got along better with her than me and then she says she might as well hookup with someone else on NYE. Then she calls her brother and tells him that she might be joining he and his girlfriend for NYE 3 hours away... Alone. I lose it and tell her to leave. She does and has been at her brothers since NYE. \r\n\r\nWe talked about how stupid the situation is and I've asked her to come back but now she needs \"space and time\" before she's ready...

Some of the people in my year got into pretty serious trouble when they bullied a fellow classmate. To be clear, I absolutely 100% don't agree with what they did. Basically this classmate H. was helping them out with math and physics at his own house and they \"repaid\" him by snooping around his laptop while he was in the bathroom. They found screenshots of his conversations with this other guy and basically outed him by sharing them so they could have a laugh. I don't think he was officially out back then although everyone already considered him gay but it's still a downright shitty thing to do. Those classmates were suspended but H. changed schools after the end of last term, not that I blame him.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I was never best friends with H. but before the whole fiasco we were on okay terms and sometimes we'd hang out after school because we both attend music classes. I haven't heard from him in months until two weeks ago, when he messaged me on Instagram. I was surprised but we talked a little, I asked him about the new school, how his family's doing etc. and he asked me about my life. So we caught up, then this past week H. asked me if I'd like to grab a drink with him sometime because he feels guilty about completely cutting out people from school after all the shit that happened and if I'd like, he would want to talk to me in person.\r\n\r\nHere's some more context though, my town is pretty damn small. Around 8,000 people, and whether you like it or not, you're bound to run into someone you know when you're out and about. So I don't know if this makes me an asshole, but I'm scared of being teased for hanging out with H. if any of my classmates see me. A lot of them still hate H. since he got those guys suspended and they couldn't take their exams with the rest of us. I'm afraid of being called gay or mistaken for being on a date with H.

Jason likes her but is too cautious to try anything since Em still has a boyfriend of 3 years. The boyfriend doesn\u2019t like our roommate and it caused tension in their relationship. Now, since two weeks ago, I come home and find Em chilling the in couch and staying until past midnight just talking to jason. Like literally just talking and I can hear them through the walls when I try to fall asleep. I really think she\u2019s shady AF by how she conducted herself around our roommate, especially knowing that she broke up with her boyfriend to be with him. I\u2019m also pretty sure Jason gave her the keycode to get past the apt gate and that makes me super uncomfortable. Now she\u2019s over practically every other day and I can\u2019t even be comfortable when I go outside my room to be in the kitchen.

I said i didn\u2019t really care since I wasn\u2019t the one who keeps inviting herself to the apt all the time. I know my animosity against Em could caused my bf to be isolated from his friend group. I really don\u2019t care about his friend group but I know it\u2019ll make him sad if he is pushed out because of me. I\u2019ve told my bf about my bad feelings about her and he understood. He also doesn\u2019t like her but he knows she\u2019s an integral part of his friend group.\r\n\r\nShould I be nice to Em for the sake of my bf even though she\u2019s SHADY AF?

Likewise when Jane went, the same situation applied. Jack went for chemistry, Jane went for kinesiology. Jill finished highschool and took a gap year and is looking to start in January.\r\n\r\nWe paid for Jack and Jane's school because university here in Ontario is relatively cheap after you account for grants. It's something like $5,000 tuition per year, but they both received anywhere from $3,500 to $4,000 per year in grants and bursaries, with the remainder being loans. Some of these grants were based on academics, but the majority is based on income and other factors. It's very cheap to go to school here because these grants are available to everyone, basically.\r\n\r\nBut we also paid for them because both my husband and I found their program choices have merit and real world applications.

We fought all the time, we broke up and got back together easily 50 times and he did some truly terrifying things to me while we would fight (for example screaming at me while driving and then taking his hands off the wheel saying he didn't care if we crashed). I wanted to be equitable and say we were both responsible but he probably has some narcissism, definitely had substance abuse problems and he started most of the fights. I finally broke up with him for good and I'm thinking the last time I saw him was easily six years ago. \r\n\r\nI met my husband 4 years ago. To me, he's the dream guy. He's handsome, he's an ER physician, he's athletic, he's so sweet and thoughtful, he makes me belly laugh nearly ever day and we are on the same page when it comes to just about everything. It was love at first sight when he was in med school and I was starting work and we have basically been inseparable ever since. I would never cheat on him or anything like that ever. I love our life together and don't ever want to risk anything. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy husband had to work all weekend and it's really important to note that occasionally he'll work with something at the ER that he has a hard time letting go of and I know I need to give him some space when he gets home and there is for sure some not good times to drop news on him. The specifics of the patient he treated are horrifying (it was a little girl, really that's all I want to say) and he's going to the hospital today about seeking some sort of counseling, i'm very proud of him but this is not the time to drop my drama on him. That's very important going forward with the rest of the story. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo Friday night I got a call from a number I didn't recognize figured it was a robocall so I didn't answer. Voicemail was from my college ex-boyfriend. It basically said he knew this was out of the blue but he's been in addiction recovery and he's trying to make amends with all the people he hurt and if there was any way he'd love to meet with me to see if I could help him figure why things were so bad with us and how he could move on. I didn't respond on Friday night but Saturday my mom and sister cancelled their plans with me and really out of boredom and a morbid fascination with what my ex was up to, I called him back.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe met at a mall and he looked awful, like years of hard and fast living had really taken it's toll. We had a nice conversation for maybe 15 minutes and then he just started picking at me like we were dating again. He started accusing me of being distant and not appreciating small gestures he would do for me (like leaving meth roses on my car then expecting that would make me want to outdo porn stars in gratuitousness of sex acts). I must have regressed into my old self because instead of getting up and walking away I got defensive and we had an obnoxious fight right in the middle of the mall. Finally I had enough and told him flat out \"Brent, THIS, THIS is why you have problems. You asked for my help and you wound up screaming at me for things that happened 7 years ago! GET HELP!\" and I walked away. He followed me saying something like \"I've always loved you, please don't walk away, I need help. I think we can make it work.\" The last thing I said to him that I was married and wanted him to leave me alone. He kept following me so I went into a store and told the very, very (like literally awesome amazing I'd love to give a shout out and get them business but not sure if it's ok) women that I was being followed so the let me in their back room while they called security. I waited and apparently that scared him off because I didn't see him again. While I was waiting I just blocked his number because I was sure a barrage of texts and calls was coming. After maybe 30 minutes two security guys walked me to my car and I was so freaked out I went and got my husband lunch, and spent the rest of the day hanging out in the ER break room and then followed him home when he left so we arrived together. \r\n\r\n\r\nI just told him that I missed him and since my mom and sister cancelled I was lonely and wasn't sure else where to go. He was very happy to have me around even thought we didn't get to see each other much. \r\n\r\n\r\nPart of me feels really bad for not telling my husband what happened but I know that after his work weekend my drama needs to come in a distant second to his mental health. There were many things in this where I am the asshole and I guess I certainly feel like it for letting my boredom guide me into a making a bad choice to having a screaming match in the mall to not telling my husband what happened. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that, am I the asshole for any and all the above?\r\n"}, "118": {"id": "bu96sw", "title": "AITA for taking unused toiletries from an Airbnb?", "body": "This is my first post ever.

This is nice, **BUT IN THIS SITUATION** it worked AGAINST me, because I would likely have girls approaching me and trying to dance with me while my two cousins were there. \r\n\r\nI thought the reverse would be true. I'd see guys try to approach my cousins as well.\r\n\r\nWell, I made sure to drink very little because I didn't want to do anything stupid, and when I got to the club, I didn't see many guys approach my cousins. However, I got approached by one girl at the start of the night who tried talking to me on the dancefloor, and I motioned her with my hands to go away (hand gestured her to fuck off basically).\r\n\r\nMy cousins saw that. Then later on in the night, another girl approached me and tried to grind up on me, this was awkward as fuck, and I whispered in her ear ''Fuck off'. \r\n\r\nI got death stares from that girl and her friend group, and my cousins were weirded out at seeing girls approach me.\r\n\r\nI felt like I was on high alert really, with my cousins there. So one more girl approached me later on and tried to talk, and again, I just left and went to the toilet to ditch her. \r\n\r\nI was on high alert the whole night, and any time a girl tried to approach me, I shot them down. But I feel it was warranted given the circumstances. Had my cousins not been there, I likely would have pursued it further with these girls because I thought they looked okay.

He asked me why I didn't choose one of the two we decided on. He said he didn't really want to name her Whitney, but when I told him how much I loved it, he just kind of dropped it until his brother and sister flew up to visit a week after she was born.

It has been revealed that this was probably something more important to him than me and I should have moved. \r\nJust a reminder to those giving life advise, that you are seeing only 5 of the worst minutes of a 21 year relationship, so please just judge the situation and try not to make judgements on my character in general. Cheers.\r\n\r\nA bit of background: I (21M) find myself in a dilemma with this current scenario, not knowing whether I was being unreasonable or not, it has knocking about in my head for the past couple of days with no definitive conclusion. Me and my dad normally have quite a good relationship, but I felt really sourly towards him after this scenario and have a few times in my life, really resented him. In contrast, the relationship I have with my mum is fantastic and we rarely disagree on anything.\r\n\r\nSo, to the story: I have just dropped my girlfriend with her parents so that we can both have the day with our respective families. I get back to our holiday home and ask if anyone needs help preparing for our family lunch. Only little help is needed and my two siblings and grandmother are already sitting at the table, and there is still quite a while before lunch is served. I take a seat at the head of the table as to not have my back to the kitchen, where people are cooking, but still able to be involved in conversation. We chat for about an hour before lunch is beginning to be laid out on the table.\r\n\r\nMy father was responsible for the barbecue (we live in New Zealand, so it is summer time, and a relatively overcast day). As he puts the barbecued food on the table he asks relatively politely if I can move so that he can sit where I am. I ask politely in return why he wants to sit here. He answers by saying again that is where he would like to sit, so I say no, with my rationale being that his reasoning is simply the same as my reasoning to be sitting in this spot, plus I have the added reasoning being that I am already in said seat.\r\n\r\nHe goes to get something from the kitchen for the table and comes back and states that if I do not move he will be very angry with me, to which I reply that if I cannot sit here, then I will simply leave. My dad then goes into the garage to do something which I do not know. In the mean time the rest of my family convinces me to move seats, and we go on with our Day.\r\n\r\nFurther backstory and my current thoughts: 1st: at our holiday home there are not the kind of allocated seating plans that we have at home where each person sits at the same place when having a family meal. Plus, there were guests which normally throws all prior seating normalities out the window. 2nd: I don\u2019t like doing things simply because someone says so. 3rd: I don\u2019t like how in the end, the burden had fallen to me to be the one to be the grown up and move when he was the one causing the fuss. 4th: the only seat left was next to my mum (his wife) and if it were me I\u2019d much rather sit next to my SO than at the head of the table\r\n\r\nTrying to view from my dads side: I am finding it difficult to view from his side (hence the post). But if I were to speculate the most reasonable cause for him wanting me to move was because it is his house and should be able to sit where he wants. If I go into less reasonable reasons, it could be some weird power move or some bull hierarchical subconscious thing, where he wouldn\u2019t feel like a man if is son were at the head of the table.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post but I am really struggling with this one and kinda need an unbiased third party at this point for my own sanity. Also, I know that I am probably biased towards my own point of view, but am having a hard time getting over that for this specific case.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: my dad asked me to move from the head of the table which I had been sitting at for an hour, I said no, he got upset, I moved when my family convinced me, when dad left the room"}, "154": {"id": "aw05fe", "title": "AITA For walking away?", "body": "I 22M have opted to just walk away from 20F after a month of \u201ctalking\u201d to see how things would go and to see if dating would be an option. \r\n\r\nFor context I have depression, insomnia and despise everything about myself and am in my final year of uni, she has a lot of stress due to getting a new job and medical issues currently which she may need surgery for later in the year.\r\n\r\nYesterday we were talking as usual and then she sent me a paragraph which when paraphrased said this \u201cwe both have a lot of our own issues to deal with currently, as much as she has tried she can\u2019t seem to like me to make things work and she can\u2019t ignore that it won\u2019t work and she\u2019s been trying to and doesn\u2019t seem to be getting there.

I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,\r\n\r\nI have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.\r\n\r\nRecently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.\r\n\r\nThe thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nAlso, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.\r\n\r\nTLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes. I tell her she can go but that it would make me a little uncomfortable.

However, I also am friends with people who do not have anything to do with science or academia, and I think they have valuable skillsets that are different than mine.\r\n\r\nMy cousin (31M) studied political science at the university, but slowly started to verge his carreer after being dissatisfied with the jobs he worked. He started teaching himself calculus, programming and statistics, also enrolling in official university online courses, at last he managed to land a job as a data scientist.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was out with him and a friend of mine and we started discussing about education and so on (my cousin's boyfriend is a teacher in high school). Somehow the topic came out of liquids and weight and measures and so on and, almost as a joke, I asked my cousin how many grams would 10ml of water weight. He couldn't answer, but he was in and thinking about it, so I started giving hints such as \"think about how much water there is in a glass\", or \"how much does a liter weight\", \"how many milliliters are there in a liter\" etc... \r\nLong story short, at some point among these hints I said \"come on, how big is a 1l cube (we use metric)?\" And he couldn't tell me. At this point, though, I reacted with a flabbergasted face and was honestly incredolous that he didn't know this.\r\n\r\nHe then started being upset at first, since he thought I was mocking him. He became even more upset when I mentioned that I though this was basic knowledge that people get thought in elementary school, and repeated until high school. He then said I am an elitist and that I shouldn't shit on people because I'm in a bubble, and that there are many things that he somehow takes for granted that I don't know. \r\nI said I believed this, and I honestly do, but that I didn't think I lack such basic knowledge in any \"basic\" area of life. I then started listing many \"basic\" knowledges that I think are indispensable for an adult, with none of them being \"scientific\" knowledge (i.e.: how money works, basic healthcare , knowing one foreign language, using a computer, how to drive a screw with a screwdriver and so on...).\r\nHe proceeded to call me an elitist asshole again, that I was gatekeeping, and started listing many things he studied and that I obviously didn't know. I would like to point out, though, that the examples he made were coming from topics he studied at university and not tought in school to first graders.\r\n\r\nI apologized at the moment, because I didn't want to make him upset again, but honestly I do think and mean the things I said.\r\n\r\nSo reddit, AITA for believing EVERYBODY should have basic ground knowledge of several topics, that school teaches things to young children for a reason, and that if you forget these or never learn them then you are to blame if this surprises people?\r\n\r\nEDITS: I read the comments and I understand I was at wrong.

He\u2019s lived there about 6 months and does not remember his code to call for guests to get into the building. I\u2019ve told him he should just ask the leasing office what it is but he refuses because tbh he\u2019s super awkward. \r\n\r\nSo instead of me just being able to call him on the Intercom system for him to just press a button and it let me up he has to come all the way down stairs to let me in. He\u2019s on the 15th floor and absolutely hates this. Sometimes people will just let me in the building but a lot of the times I\u2019ve already called on my phone and told him I\u2019m here so he starts to come down.

He was going out of town and he gave me his keys and key fob so I could go over and check on his cat and make sure all is well in his apartment over the next week. \r\n\r\nSo yesterday I was in 711 and I suddenly noticed a key maker in there. It had pictures of a normal key and a key fob on it. I was pretty curious so I went over to it and put his key fob into it to see how much it would cost. It said it would only cost me $25 to duplicate it and honestly I thought that was a great deal and something cool I could surprise my BF with. \r\n\r\nI ended up duplicating it and leaving the store to call him and tell him. When I called him to tell him he got really pissed at me though and said I was going to be violating his privacy. I was super confused and said I only got it so he wouldn\u2019t have to always come down to let me in and he said that was bullshit and I just wanted to be able to show up to his apartment whenever I wanted. I reminded him I have never done that ever and if I did want to I could easily wait till someone let me in the building instead of spending $25 to do so.\r\n\r\nHe told me we would talk about it when he got home but I would not be keeping the duplicate key fob and I\u2019ve seriously disrespected him and violated his right to privacy.

We have our small fights here and there, as all couples do when they first experience being around each other 24/7, but nothing serious.  She can be stubborn and temperamental (as can I), but I love her so much and I can't wait to marry her.  However, she has one quirk that really rubs me the wrong way sometimes.  For background, she's a pretty light sleeper, whereas I could probably sleep through a tornado.  If she goes to bed first, there's a good chance that me attempting to get into bed will wake her, no matter how quiet I think I'm being. The problem is that I'm a notorious snorer.  According to my family, my snoring sounds like a wild boar (I've recorded myself and I don't think it's THAT bad, but can confirm it's fairly loud).  Since we moved to our apartment, my fianc\u00e9 has only gotten worse in her light sleeping habits, partially due to her paranoia of a new environment (we don't live in the safest area ever, lots of break-ins, robberies, etc. so it's not exactly baseless).  This means that if she's not dead asleep when I go to bed, my snoring can evidently wake her up pretty easily.  My issue is that if my snoring wakes her up, she will then wake ME up, regardless of what time it is, and make me adjust my pillows or turn over or whatever to try to make me stop.  This usually doesn't work, so she'll wake me up AGAIN and try again. The worst is that if her calling to me doesn't wake me, she'll sometimes nudge me pretty hard in the side.  I haven't said anything to her, as I know she's a light sleeper and that's not her fault, but it sometimes really annoys me that she will wake me up an hour before I have to get up for work just because she wants me to stop snoring, which is something I have very little control over, especially since I get up early (around 6 a.m.) and she gets several more hours of sleep after I'm gone (she's a student and her classes usually won't start until 9 or 10 a.m.). So, I want to ask her to stop waking me up, as I don't get enough sleep already, and her waking me only makes me more exhausted when I do get up. I've considered a CPAP, but that's a lot of money for a loud machine that would probably also wake her and wouldn't necessarily fix my snoring.  WIBTA for bringing this up to her?\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Fianc\u00e9 will wake me up for snoring and waking her often, and I want to ask her to stop.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks for all the helpful comments, my guys.

(My friends and I are extremely close, we all consider each other basically family so we've been seeing each other a lot over break as we all miss each other very much) I respond with a no. My mother asks why, and I explain the various things my friends are doing. It just so happens that I bring up that my friend, who is jewish, (not heavily observant) is hosting her family for christmas. My mother looks surprised, and asks why. \r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused by this. Why does anyone host their family? Who knows! So I respond that that's just their family tradition, but my mother still looks confused. She then asks why my friend would celebrate christmas if she's jewish? I say that I don't know, that's just what they do, and they like doing it so why shouldn't they? My mother then repeats \"but they're jewish\". So I talk a little bit about how she's only jewish on one side side of the family, and how christmas is for anyone who wants to celebrate it, the secular aspects are pretty easy to divorce from the religious ones, and christmas is such a big cultural thing it's not all that surprising. My mother once again emphasizes that my friend's family is jewish, and she's sort of implying that it's weird. \r\n\r\nNow, my friends are my family, and I don't really like it when someone questions what seems to me a perfectly valid decision of theirs. So I say to my mother that my friend is free to celebrate whatever holiday she wishes, and that it's kinda weird to criticize her family 's choices. In my opinion, how they celebrate the holidays and practice their religion is their business, and I'm not too happy to have my mother questioning how my friend spends the holidays. \r\n\r\nMy mother tells me that I'm being combative, and she doesn't appreciate me jumping to conclusions. This is also the point at which my father joins the conversation, to agree with my mother that I am acting rudely. My mother adds that she is unimpressed with my behavior, and that she hopes I don't behave like this outside of the home. I say that I don't really appreciate them questioning the choices of my friends when there seems to be no reason to do so. My parents repeat that they are dismayed by my behavior and they want me to cease jumping to conclusions. My mother adds again that this is behavior she hopes I do not demonstrate elsewhere. I thank them for their input, and say that I will consider what they had to say, and then I leave the table, as the situation is escalating into something I don't want to be a part of. \r\n\r\nI don't really think I'm TA here, but any input would be greatly appreciated, and of course I will accept any judgment that is handed down."}, "165": {"id": "e8snr7", "title": "WIBTA for telling ex's new man she told me she was pregnant.", "body": "Me 26m and my ex 29f broke up a few months ago.

I don't remember) I previously consented to her biting my neck a previous week (Even as an adult I like hickeys.)

I went to the ER about a week later bc I couldn't lift my arm and I had such a painful, numbing sensation that I just couldn't take it. ER happened, they told me I need to get an MRI referral bc they don't do that at the hospital. Disheartening, but okay. So I go to my primary doc's office and make an appt so I can get a referral. The new practitioner referred me to a place for walk-in MRIs. I said that's awesome! I'll go there right away. Turns out, she referred me to the wrong place; they don't do that there. I had to go to the ER again about 3 weeks later bc the pain was so bad again. This time was the first time I got the \"brain bleed\" sensation. I was assured that my brain was not bleeding. First time at the ER was an x-ray, I'm fine. Second time was a CT, brain not bleeding. Each out of pocket copay was 150 dollars.  Second time I went they said \"haven't you gone to a neurologist yet?\" No, I'm working on referrals and getting into a specialist.

As a closeted gay, it was cool to have someone I\u2014 at the time, 23M\u2014 could relate to and possibly come out to, which I eventually did. \r\n\r\nStill in the closet to the family back home, because it\u2019s the deep south and they\u2019re deeply devout Baptists\u2014 parents far more so than siblings to the point I actually believe my mother would kill herself if she found out, but more because it might be the needle that breaks the camel\u2019s back after what enormous disappointments she believes most of my other siblings to have been for her so far and she confided in me when I was younger that I was \u201cher favorite\u201d. This is in top of warning signs I\u2019ve noticed in her speech as she\u2019s already overworked and overstressed between her thanklessly low-paying school job and rocky marriage; warning signs which I recognize as I\u2019m already guilty of burdening them with a couple of suicide scares myself in the past.

I\u2019d never, ever been intimate in any measure with another non-relative before\u2014 I had been forbidden to start dating (ha!) or to even have a part-time job during high school and college so I could focus on academics (and thus no need for a car or drivers license), resulting in zero autonomy to really have any sort of social life outside of classes.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was practically vibrating with nerves and excitement. Not that Z knew any of my baggage at the time.\r\n\r\nSo in the cuddling, contact slowly becomes more and more intimate, both of us testing the waters and pushing boundaries up to the point that he kisses me\u2014 not a peck, but full-on Frenching.\r\n\r\nHormones and a decade of repressed sexuality take over and we basically jerk each other off.

I learn that he\u2019s led a much more boisterous and experimental youth than I have from a much younger age, being basically 7 years my senior in terms of relationship experience yet I\u2019m 3 years older.\r\n\r\nZ is generally cool and sort of an average-looking guy, not bad but quite far from the \u201ctype\u201d I\u2019m actually attracted to. But I don\u2019t want to tell him this, especially since after he says I happen to be HIS type and that he likes me, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have advanced on me.\r\n\r\nJuxtapose my lack of real attraction to Z with my almost-incel level of starvation for both a relationship and intimacy, then throw on some deeply-ingrained religious guilt from my upbringing. Now add on our awkward 3 year physical age difference, and to make it even more confusing top it all off with the 7-year gap in relationship experience he has over me. I was overwhelmed, desperate to have something but at the same time not wanting to \u201csettle\u201d for him. I also never told Z my age, letting him assume we were around even.\r\n\r\nI tried to chicken out of committing to anything by using my home and closet situation as an excuse. Basically, that I can\u2019t give him a full in-the-open relationship because I feared for my mother\u2019s life if she found out... which was only partially true, because I\u2019ve no doubt I could easily hide a relationship while in a different city. What I didn\u2019t tell him was that I didn\u2019t see him as boyfriend material.\r\n\r\nBut I still wasn\u2019t ready to give up our newfound intimacy after having that first taste, so I had him settle for a no-strings-attached Friends With Benefits deal. He would come to me on nights he felt lonely, and I would let Netflix and Chill take its natural course. The whole year, I felt guilty that I might be preventing Z from committing to a more fulfilling relationship with other LGBT friends he found on campus, while I was more of a recluse who never went out with his groups nor could even remember their names. Despite claiming there was no strings attached between us and being generally unattracted to him, I did desire something more romantic and one night Z confessed that he thought I was frustrated with him for \u201cnot putting out\u201d more often, which I denied. However as much as I tried lying to myself, I did start to feel twinges of jealousy whenever he spent the night elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt never got more serious between us than occasional handjobs and cuddling, and one time I attempted to give my first blowjob. Towards the end of the year I started trying to push things further (MUCH further) than cuddling in the heat of the moment, probably making Z uncomfortable as he would break it off early and leave\u2014 our nights together started to become rarer and more awkward.\r\n\r\nAll the while I was continuing to basically lie to him, never revealing that I didn\u2019t really find him attractive and only wanted him out of convenience.\r\n\r\nThe academic year ended and he barely said goodbye to me, and we sort of immediately stopped texting each other over the summer. This year Z is no longer my roommate, and though we\u2019ve run into each other a couple times and I\u2019ve invited him to text me more often, but neither of us have initiated further contact in the several months since and at this point I feel too awkward to try.\r\n\r\nWe never had any proper closure, but even though we both understood what we had was \u201cno-strings-attached,\u201d I still feel like I was dishonestly leading Z on out of convenience without wanting to commit to a real relationship and that spoiled any chance we might have had at a casual friendship afterward. And maybe he resents me a bit for that. The age gap also makes me feel dirty as if I was using him, which I guess I was, but the reverse gap in experience also makes it so confusing since this is my first time dealing with another person\u2019s feelings on equal ground in an intimate context.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: I used my in-the-closet sob story as a flimsy excuse to lead on my younger roommate who liked me into being just friends with benefits even though I found him unattractive, and then almost pushed past the no-strings-attached boundary out of thirst rather than romance until he started putting distance between us. And now that we\u2019re not roommates anymore we basically ghost each other. I feel like I\u2019ve mishandled my first relationship, except under the pretense of there being nothing between us, and by extension spoiled what could have been a lasting friendship with the first person I ever came out to.**\r\n\r\nSo Reddit: am I an asshole?"}, "172": {"id": "cuuakk", "title": "AITA for taking a shower before my sister?", "body": "Mobile disclaimer\r\n\r\nSo today I (m,16) came back from a run and got myself something to drink because I was thirsty.

This is a throwaway and my GF doesn\u2019t use reddit so I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m exposing anything about our lives\r\n\r\nSo we\u2019ve been together for about a year and a half. She\u2019s great and we get along well and our sex life is decent. I\u2019m just gonna jump into the meat of it.\r\n\r\nEarly in our relationship, I expressed that I prefer women to be bare. That\u2019s just my preference and she said she preferred just keeping herself trimmed down there. Sometimes she goes a while without shaving her legs or pits too but whatever, it isn\u2019t a super big deal because she still keeps it neat but I\u2019m not super into it. \r\n\r\n(I\u2019ve never told her to do anything, I get that it\u2019s her body and choice, I just told her my preference)\r\n\r\nAnyways over the past month we started experimenting with anal. I\u2019ve kinda noticed she has hair in her ass (I don\u2019t know how to put it gentler) while we were doing regular doggy and it was kind of a turn off but I just ignored it.\r\n\r\nBut now that we\u2019ve been experimenting with anal, it\u2019s a lot more noticeable because I\u2019m interacting with that whole area. She has dark and long hair on her head and it looks the same down there (sorry). Just really gross to me. Her area is kind of discolored too which is really unappealing but I wouldn\u2019t ask her to bleach, it\u2019s just a really disappointing experience with anal. (She\u2019s clean, it just doesn\u2019t look great)\r\n\r\nAnyways I asked her if she could shave it at least before we do anal. We don\u2019t plan anal really but we imply it while we\u2018re getting heated. I told her the hair there is a turn off for me and I just don\u2019t find it attractive. It\u2019s gross.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me all hurt like I asked her to kill her cat. She said \u201cUmmmm\u201d and she was blushing so I think she got embarrassed. Then she got really offended and defensive and asked me why I even have sex with her if I find her unattractive, that life wasn\u2019t like porn, that if she never shaved to begin with then I should\u2019ve just kept it to myself. I was shocked and told her that I didn\u2019t find HER unattractive, just the pubic hair, and she told me assholes weren\u2019t supposed to be pretty and that I was acting really immature.\r\n\r\nSo we had kind of a fight about it that really derailed. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. But she seems really different now, she doesn\u2019t like when I compliment her, she scowls at me, she doesn\u2019t want to have sex anymore when I initiate.

She used to have to take insulin at night, but now it's moved to insulin after each meal. \r\n\r\nBasically, her diabetes is getting worse. On top of this, she hasn't had a job in over a year, and relies on my SO's father to take care of her. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't think much of this except there is the fact that she kinda treats him like shit and she's really good at putting the blame of her life being so shitty on other people or the fact that she has depression. When my SO or my SO's father tries to talk to her about changing she gets super defensive and then tells them \"it's the depression\". \r\n\r\nNow, I don't have depression, so I couldn't possibly know what it's like.

We're all really stressed out but she still doesn't seem to budge. She'll still buy chips and cake and eat it.

I wouldn't want my child to be growing up around a ticking time bomb.

Im thinking maybe doing it for a year and then regardless of what happens break the blockage. WIBTA if I pulled this move on my mother in law?\r\n\r\nUpdate: Decided to not go through with it. My MIL needs help to change but I won't be able to do it.

Around 4 months before I met her, my sister announced she is having a destination wedding. Being that I was single, I asked my friend (22f) if she wanted to go with me. There has never been anything romantic between us and that is one of the things we value about our friendship. I promised her that even if I got into a relationship, we would still go because I think it would be shitty of me to take that away from a long standing friend and give it to a relatively newer girlfriend. After a few months, we both ended up in happy and supportive relationships. As it turns out, my friend and gf went to the same high school together, but did not interact much as they were very different people back then. To give some perspective on the gf, she is someone who goes far out of her way to accommodate others and make people feel comfortable, putting her own happiness second to those around her. We are both great communicators and are always able to talk through our problems. I brought up the destination wedding trip and details early on in the relationship so it wouldn't be a surprise, and it didn't seem to be an issue initially. Over time, her friends (who I believe were only looking out for her) expressed concern that I was going to a romantic destination wedding with someone that is not her, and that they think it is inappropriate. When she met my family, they brought up the wedding on multiple separate occasions forgetting that she was not going, and when we reminded them of this, she was met with \"oh we wish you were going.\" Reasonably, these things got to her and built up to her being adamantly against the concept of the trip. By this I mean that she never asked me not to go, and she never asked me to let her go instead of my friend, but she said that she does not want contact with me while I am gone, and does not want to hear about the trip. She has stated that when I return, if she can forget it ever happened and move on, then we will be fine, but if she can't get past it, then our relationship is likely over. I feel like I am doing the right thing by keeping my promise, but she feels like the right thing would have been for me to realize months ago that this is inappropriate and to take her instead (even though she did not ask me to do that).

She made me brownies and I gave her some rum cakes from the trip and we caught up and joked around.

I also wanted to invite another guy, Dean (26M), who some people of the chat know, and who I thought would blend with the crowd really well. Sam likes him a lot, btw.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I found out Molly is dating Dean, and I was really surprised and I told her that he is going to be at the party for the chat that \r\nI\u2019m hosting. That\u2019s how she found out about the party. She is seemingly upset for being uninvited so I tell her the reason I don\u2019t want her to be there and add that now that she\u2019s dating Dean, I don\u2019t want it even more, because god-knows-what can happen if Sam finds out they\u2019re dating (he has anger issues). She becomes even more upset and tells me she\u2019s kinda sad because she has been great friends with me for a couple of years now, and we only grew close with Sam this fall. \r\n\r\nEDIT: The second time I invited the whole chat. There\u2019s another guy in there who has a tense relationship with half of us, technically he was invited too, but he refused to come. Sam is in the chat and Molly is not so for me to invite her and not invite him I would have had to say \u2018Sorry bro everyone is welcome but you\u2019 and I don\u2019t wanna cause drama. \r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I should probably retell the joke she made. Sam (who is straight, but the group is LGBT-friendly) is good friends with Mike (21M) who is gay, and Mike told Molly that Sam hung out at his place overnight for some time.

This has grown to become a big anxiety for her and she has brought it up a few times in the past.\r\n\r\nSome more context: we have a dog and my wife is very diligent about ensuring he doesn\u2019t eat foods that are bad for dogs (garlic, onions, artificial sweeteners, etc) while my mother is not as diligent and has fed the dog bad foods repeatedly, usually out of ignorance and not malice. Even after being reminded, she will forget or laugh it off sometimes.\r\n\r\nMy wife recently asked me to talk to my mother about ensuring she listens to what my wife wants to do for our child.

We\u2019ve been planning the trip since January and talk about it often.\r\n\r\nFor this entire year, our friend group has consisted of just the 4 of us. However, another friend (\u201cJenna\u201d/17F) has entered the equation as of the past month or so. I\u2019ve personally known her for three years (longer than I\u2019ve known all of the friends in my current group), and we were best friends for a while last year. Friend A has known her since kindergarten and isn\u2019t really a fan of Jenna. Friend B has known her for a few years and they\u2019re pretty close.

This leaves some money leftover to buy another ticket... for someone like Jenna. Though she hasn\u2019t said anything about it, it\u2019s pretty much impossible for her to not know that we\u2019re going soon. Like I mentioned before, we talk about it a lot. Last night we mentioned it several times, and I felt bad about it, because we haven\u2019t been planning on inviting Jenna.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked to all of my friends about it. Friend A doesn\u2019t want her to come. Friend B and Friend C would like her to come.

In context to me implies that she sees me as not a \"smart kid\" when me and my boyfriend make similar grades, many of mine even being 1 or 2 percents higher than his.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe has denied my boyfriend seeing me with no real explanation. She's grounded him and taken his phone after he hung out with me, but has not directly stated that as the reason. To be precise she punished him without telling him why he's being punished at all. This has happened several times.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past, she let my BF hang out with another girl.

Her wedding pictures seem to put her in the 140-170 range. The one friend is of heavier stature. And I am underweight. I am worried for her as she breathes heavily when walking or doing anything minorly tiring and I have no understanding of how someone can double their weight in 20 years.

He just started last summer and honestly, he's really good considering he never seriously did theatre plays before. He also says it helps him a lot with school stress which is always good.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this is a small and relatively new group. They've only been in one competition in the last two years. It's also disorganized since it has bunch of different people with their own personal obligations. My friend always makes fun of their inability to agree about rehearsal and complains about the incompetence of some members who're literally just another person's friend or a cousin.\r\n\r\nWell here's the thing, they recently did a short French play \"The Chairs\" and I came to watch it. Most of the audience was friends, family, classmates of the students in the group. My friend was really good if you ask me because he actually put in effort, but the play looked rushed and disorganized. A lot of the people forgot their lines or just didn't know how to understand them, so there were some awkward silences.\r\n\r\nSome of us classmates hung out later and people started commenting the play. One girl pointed out how some actors just basically didn't understand their lines. Nobody disagreed so I joked that there's a lot of nepotism in that group (half of them being cousins, friends) and that's why they don't even try to be good.\r\n\r\nI probably said that weirdly because my friend got mad. He told me later in private that it's embarassing for me to criticize him and his friends so openly, and that I should tell him one-on-one about these opinions. So he thinks I was referring to him in the nepotism part because one of the people in the group is his best friend. That's not true, I think he's one of the best actors but he's not convinced now, he thinks it was a passive-aggressive comment. I think he's also angry because I said that while the guy he likes was in the room, but that's just my guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway AITA?

My wife did in fact bring it up to my dad (much to my annoyance at first) she just politely asked him why he never calls him Jackson, and he laughed and actually said \"why would I even flirt with that idea when JR is so much better\" I fucking thought wifey was gonna go Laura Dern in BLL (yes I am  a man, yes I watched that show, and yes I think those women are nation treasures, moving on now)\r\n\r\nMy wife then reminded him that he should flirt with the idea because Jackson is indeed his name, and she would disagree with JR being better, which is evident do to the fact that's what her and I both decided on. (This is the exact situation I was refering to that would happen) \r\n\r\nDad says he's grandpa, it's his first grandson and will continue to call him JR and then brought me into it, asking if  I mind. At this point, I was more pissed off at my dad for openly admitting he had no intentions of calling our son by his name, and then telling my wife he could care less how she felt about it (which I am also TA for, I accept my fate, thank you Reddit) and told my dad to refer to him as Jackson, ( no sleeping on the couch for this guy) \r\n\r\nMy wife then more or less told him that if our son chooses to go by a nickname, then that would be fine, but because he's a baby and can't decide for himself, he came out of her juju, so she speaks for him right now ( and I ain't gonna disagree with that)\r\n\r\nHonestly, bad jokes aside, I feel like an idiot for brushing it off, my FIL is an amazing, strong man and father and I am very proud to have our son named after him, and I let the thought of what I perceived as petty conflict, overlook what my wife was feeling, and I am an ass for that.\r\n\r\nThank you everyone for taking the time to respond, my dad is very pissed off right now and I guess I will see how that plays out and where we all go from here."}, "197": {"id": "c307c4", "title": "WIBTA if I told my friends about a closeted boy I'm seeing?", "body": "Alright so I'm 15m and I've been talking to a boy (16m) for couple of weeks.

So I said i'll go out and wait for him outside. \r\nHe agreed, but then he got closer and said \"or maybe stay here I dont mind\" \r\nMe, being rational, said that we shouldnt do this as I have gone down the \"fuck your best friend\" road since I've been there before and it didnt turn out so great.\r\nHe agreed at first, but then said that it will be a one time thing and nothing will change after that. \r\nI clearly liked him, and I wanted that to happen honestly, and the fact that he wanted it too made me feel desired. \r\n\r\nSo we did it. Twice that night. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the second round, he asked me if I wanted a drink, I confirmed, so he brought his liquor bottle. Now I remember that that bottle was full that morning. Now it was basically empty. \r\nI asked, \"when did you drink all this?\" \r\nHe said that it was basically before I arrived to his room. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, when we woke the morning after, he had no idea that it had happened. \r\n\r\nI would recognize a drunk man, especially my best friend drunk, but he was acting so normally before we had sex so I didnt even consider the thought of him being drunk.\r\n\r\nWhen him and I spoke of the matter, I told him that I didnt know that he had drank all that. I told him what happened exactly, and he was okay with it. We're still friends, and sometimes we joke about his \"forgetfulness\". \r\n\r\nAITA? Would this be considered as taking advantage of someone?\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n- He didnt smell like alcohol, not even a bit. \r\nI have seen him drunk before: he loses his reflexes, starts laughing too much (or crying), cant walk properly and ends up puking and going to bed. That night he was okay. He made sense, I didnt doubt for a second that he was intoxicated.  \r\n- I didnt drink beforehand. Him and I and the whole squad were supposed to drink after the party. I was shocked when I saw the bottle after we had sex. \r\n- He never said \" i dont like you that way\". He also never said he did. Before that night, we have never been together alone. He had always (throughout our 2 year friendship) made remarks on how sexy I look, complimented my body and so on. I assumed he didnt like me that way since he was hung up on his ex. \r\n- He did mention the fact that he would be up for it again, multiple times. \r\n- He also makes sex jokes with me, and states that \"i would be good in bed\" based on some shit astrology (he doesnt believe in horoscropes-determine-who-you-are but none of our  common friends know that we hooked up so it was his way of throwing shade without giving too much) and he smirks at me everytime he makes a joke."}, "199": {"id": "b707l7", "title": "AITA For not wanting my BF to wear Briefs?", "body": " \r\n\r\nI'm 23f, he's 22M and he wears briefs.

After my graduation I landed a full time job in IT at an Oil & Gas firm.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend is working at a supermarket part time and due to non-guaranteed hours her pay fluctuates quite dramatically from time to time.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend graduated in this year in 2019 with a Master's Degree and hated it every single part of it. So as a result, I encouraged her to go back to (community) college and pursue a 2 year course in an Arts subject because I think she's honest to god talented, it was a subject that she really enjoyed in high school and she would love to make a career in it.\r\n\r\nAs I earn significantly more than her, other people have been questioning her as to why I am not giving her money to help her live. We have discussed this and I told her that I am not willing to give her money except under the circumstances that the money is lent as a loan to be paid back, if we needed to buy groceries (no loan) or if she was running low this month and needed money for seeing friends etc (again no loan but to clarify the money given wouldn't be very much only enough to cover the experience for that day such as dinner with friends and transport back). \r\n\r\nTo alleviate some of her money issues, I have suggested her getting a student loan which she would be entitled to and this could potentially sort out her money issues entirely. However I have had some push back from her because she \"doesn't like the thought of owing all that money back\". In our country the student loan would be deducted from our paycheck only if we were earning over a certain amount per annum, if we earn under that amount or circumstances change and we earn under that threshold then we do not need to pay that back until our per annum pay is over that threshold. I explained this to her and said that even if she earned a penny over the threshold the deductions are so small and her standard of life would still be higher because her annual pay would still be 5x what she is making now. But regardless she instead said to me that if the situation were reversed, she would give me money no questions asked if I was in her situation.\r\n\r\nAfter she said that, I felt guilty because I was the one to suggest her going back to college to pursue an alternative career path which caused her to be in this situation anyway and also because we've been together for so long, it's like we're married together and I wouldn't have anyone else but her.

It\u2019s ultra worrying that she has wanted implants since she was 12. Boobs have barely just started developing at that age. Plus, I told her that most guys in my experience would prefer her beautiful natural boobs than some artificial knockoffs that probably wouldn\u2019t even fit her figure. She told me that\u2019s great how I feel that way, but it\u2019s something personal that no one but herself would understand. \r\n\r\n\r\nI stated again that it\u2019s extremely concerning that she has wanted a boob job since she was 12 and she shouldn\u2019t give into the family peer pressure that easily. Liz told me to let her do what she thinks is best for herself and not make her even more nervous than she has to be with only a few days until the surgery.

The following week, I was at an event when another older guy starts asking me about my skateboarding and my helmet to which I gave him the same answer. He kind of sneers at me, makes a comment how dangerous it is, but I just brush it off.

So here's the back story, I am a (23M) that is still in College and paying for all of my tuition and expenses. Over this past weekend I had to move out of my apartment and I needed a truck to move all of my furniture and etc. My parents have a fully loaded GMC Sierra Denali truck and they allowed me to borrow it for the week. You must also understand that this truck is my Dad's baby and keeps this truck immaculate, this also the first time he has ever let me borrow it. \r\n\r\nSo, fast forward to last night; my roommate and I decided to go get Sonic and I volunteered to drive. I honestly volunteered because I love this truck and I just want to ride around in it any chance I get because it's a million times nicer than my POS car. Anyways, we get our food and I start to back out of the slot and I get half way out and hear a horrible screech. Roommate gets out to look and I ask how bad is it? Thinking maybe it's just a little scratch it'll buff right out and he says it's bad.  My heart just sank and my anxiety levels shot through the roof. \r\n\r\nAfter taking the night to try and decide what I should. I decided I'll try and save my pride and trust that my parents had in me and find a place that can repair it. I called over 6 body shops this morning and only found one place that said they could fix it by this weekend. I looked at their reviews and it seems like they do good work so, I brought it over to their place for an estimate. After they took a look they told me that they would have to fix the dent in the door and repaint the whole door (rear passenger) and half of the front passenger door that way it can all blend and match the paint. \r\n\r\nNext came the haggling, I told them my situation and asked if they could cut me any breaks. I think the guy honestly felt bad for me and he knocked 300 bucks off the estimate. However, that estimate is still around 950 dollars. Fourntuantly, I previously finished a internship that paid me really well and I have a enough to cover it. So, I sucked it up and told them to go ahead and fix it for that quoted price. \r\n\r\nNow, here is my internal battle that I have going on in my head, should I tell them even after the repair and keep their trust in tack or spill the beans? My thought is, if the repair turns out great and you can't tell anything happened, then no harm no foul and what they don't know won't hurt them.

It\u2019s been almost a year, he\u2019s got a great job and he\u2019s been good.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s not my favorite person in the world due to his personality and how he\u2019s been playing his family for money and such, but I still try to get along with him. In may of this year, I invited him for a cookout, he gets in the car with a bag of clothes\u2026 my husband was also confused and he asked his if he was going to stay with us, and he just responded, \u201cno, I\u2019m doing laundry\u201d I just stayed quiet, I was baffled. I was doing laundry that day (I always do on Sundays), and so I never took the clothes out of the washer. One because I didn\u2019t want him to use my machines, and two I was busy doing the cooking and all. He didn\u2019t even asked to use the washer.

Yeah\u2026 our house.\r\n\r\nLast weekend, we went out on a day trip and we were going to return a bit late, and my husband tells me if he can tell his brother to come over to our house to feed the dogs while were out, I though sure. We get home, and the asshole is taking a nap in your guess room, while the dryer is going off. I lost it again, he never asked to use it, at least not to me, and I am pretty sure he did not ask my husband either, but I don\u2019t know because it been 2 days and I haven\u2019t talked to my husband since.

I was sorta interested in her and she was into me too but nothing happened. I moved away and we kept in touch on and off over social media. We ended up reconnecting my second year of college. She had a boyfriend at the time, but we started talking more often and were good friends. I eventually asked her out, but she said she would only hang out with me as a friend, not on a date. I was bummed, but took the chance to see her. It was fun, nothing happened though.\r\n\r\nShe started catching feelings for me later on and ended her relationship because she said she didn\u2019t want to cheat. We started talking more seriously, but after a month I realized I wasn\u2019t ready for something serious. She also lived a bit away and didn\u2019t have a car, so it was a 30 to 40 minute drive for me and a hassle to see her. I told her I didn\u2019t want us to talk anymore and didn\u2019t really feel like explaining why, so I stopped replying to her messages asking to talk about it. When she started getting more upset, I ghosted her and we didn\u2019t talk for six months. I realized I messed up though and asked her for another chance and to show her I was serious, that she\u2019d be my girlfriend officially this time. She was reluctant but said yes.\r\n\r\nOne thing that she had said before we started dating was that she didn\u2019t want to have sex before marriage and then after we got together, that she didn\u2019t want to unless I loved her (she was a virgin at the time). I felt like that wasn\u2019t fair because 1. she knew I wasn\u2019t a virgin and 2. I had a high libido. I also didn\u2019t think it was reasonable that I had to love her or that I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep with my girlfriend.\r\n\r\nWe dated for about a month and during this time, I actually cheated on her with another friend of mine. I eventually started feeling the same as before about the relationship, and ended up telling her it wasn\u2019t working for me a week or two later. I didn\u2019t ghost her this time and we talked for an hour. After a serious but calm discussion, we broke up. I told her about the cheating and we talked about our issues some more. After thinking later that day about our talk, I realized I didn\u2019t want us to break up, and we got back together that same day. She then told me that she felt she wasn\u2019t being fair to me before and that if I wanted to, we could have sex since she was my girlfriend after all. I was stoked and we hooked up that night. We stayed together for another month, but I started feeling like I wasn\u2019t ready for something so serious again and just wasn\u2019t as into the relationship anymore in general. I ended up breaking up with her. She was upset and said that she felt really used, but told me she understood. After we talked about how things were, what went wrong, and the relationship in general, we stopped talking.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a few months since then and I\u2019ve grown a lot as a person. I\u2019ve been doing my own thing and investing in myself, but lately I\u2019ve started thinking about her. She was really good to me and I miss our conversations. She always let me do what I want or hang out with my friends. She never asked me to come see her, but said she really appreciated when she did get to. Overall, she was really sweet and a good girlfriend.

Everyone in our family immediately accepted him, but of course that didn\u2019t stop other people from gossiping and talking shit.\r\n\r\nI\u2018ve always been very close to my little brother. He used to get bullied in school for being \u201etoo feminine\u201c (it\u2018s better now, but some guys are still rude to him), so I always saw it as my responsibility to look out for him and keep him safe from those assholes. After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I\u2018m super proud of him!\r\n\r\nOne thing my brother loves is make-up.

When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.\r\n\r\nI feel like my brother twisted my words here.

Due to the cultures we grew up in, I care a lot about other people and want to be nice to everyone and go on in my life without being a problem to others. Meanwhile, my gf couldn't care less about other people and always does things that make her comfortable, even if it would make others uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nFor example, many times we have walked past a restaurant, and she slows down or stops to stare inside of the food people are eating. Usually people are sitting by the window and look little uncomfortable when she does that. I feel uncomfortable too, especially is she fully stops. I tell her that she shouldn't stare so much, other people might find it uncomfortable, but she says she does whatever she wants.\r\n\r\nShe also doesn't care about her surroundings. She walks on the bike lanes (not on purpose) and I always have to tell her to walk on the right side of the road or watch out if some bikes or big groups of people are coming. \r\n\r\nShe might watch some videos or play music quite loud until late and around 9-10pm I have to tell her to turn it down because the neighbors might be sleeping. She might also want to start the laundry machine in the evening, and gets mad at me if I say we should do it tomorrow because it's quite loud for neighbors. She says she doesn't care.\r\n\r\nThe last thing was today when we were walking across a big street. There were no cars coming so we just crossed the lights even though they were red. However, my playful girlfriend thought it's fun to press all the buttons as we walk past them, causing the crossing's lights turn red for the drivers, and green for us. But we had already crossed the road. So now there were couple cars that had to stop at the lights even though no one was walking across the road. I told my girlfriend she shouldn't do that, because now the drivers have to wait for nothing. She got mad and said I don't like anything she does and always tell her what to do and not to do. \r\n\r\nI just care about other people and feel uncomfortable if they suffer or have to wait because of something I did. I might sound little blunt telling my girlfriend what to do or not, but I never force her to do anything. Most of the time I even try to sound not serious but happy and just slip in the conversation she probably shouldn't do something, but she still gets offended.

I opened it but as soon as I realized what was going on I immediately shut it and felt terrible. \r\n\r\nI went back to him and he asked if I found what I was looking for and I said \u201chey, you should be careful telling me to look in those drawers, there might be something people aren\u2019t supposed to find in there\u201d and he gave me an odd look and then it clicks into place and he carefully asks \u201cwell how did you feel?\u201d And I said \u201chappy and excited of course!\u201d And he starts smiling and is like \u201cwell you\u2019re just gonna have to wait!\u201d And laughs. \r\n\r\nI let it go after that, since I then felt bad for even mentioning it but since he\u2019d sent me to that drawer specifically I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it.

We have worked it out. I'm going to try to let him in on this kind of stuff more in the future, and he's going to work on trusting me to be my regular non-sketchy self. Thanks for all the input! \r\n\r\nTL;DR at the bottom. Throwaway.\r\n\r\nBackground: He (25) and I (26f) have been together in a monogamous relationship for almost three years and lived together for a large part of that. I recently moved into my own apartment because of his anger/control issues, but agreed to try to work through this with him while he works on his mental health. He is an awkward nerd, while I am much more social. I have an art degree, and he is working towards a neuroscience degree if that gives any insight into our personalities.\r\n\r\nLast night, I went over to his place to hang out for a bit and started showing him some things on here that I had saved to show him. A text notification popped up from a male friend I met on r/r4r. My boyfriend immediately goes into this rapid fire interrogation and my jaw just dropped. I have not once given this man any reason to distrust me. I have never been anything but transparent. I have never cheated on anyone and I have no intention of starting with him. He kept saying the typical \"I just think it's weird that...\" and when I responded by saying that it was unfair of him to accuse me of being disloyal, he would say, \"I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just asking questions.\" Questions like, \"Who messaged who first, and how did you exchange numbers?\" \"What do you talk about?\" \"What do you talk about? (again)\" \"Have you sent him any pictures of yourself?\" \r\n\r\nI just left. It hurt my feelings to know that three years in I am still having to defend my character to him. I will always be a social person, and I will never be dishonest or disloyal. This is just who I am and how I chose to live. It's unreal to me that he can claim love for me but get so bitter about these parts of my personality.\r\n\r\n1) I messaged my friend first because I was bored, and we hit it off. We were both slow to respond on reddit, so we exchanged numbers. I don't even know his last name, and he's never been anything but respectful. I talk to him about my boyfriend all the time. We also talk about our day, food, dogs, and life. \r\n\r\n2) I never told my boyfriend because it did not occur to me that I was obligated to update him every time I made a new friend.\r\n\r\n3) Yes, I sent pictures of myself. Nothing cute, nothing \"sexy.\" Pictures with my dog mostly, pictures from hiking, and some pictures from 10+ years ago during a conversation about changing looks/hair.\r\n\r\n4) It just seems like every time I do something that brings me joy, it infuriates my boyfriend. I never felt comfortable making art at his house because he would act like I was laying around and doing nothing but making a mess all day. If I go out with my friends, he will text me the entire time. If I bring him out with my friends, it ends in an argument over absolutely nothing. (Example: Went to a craft beer place, left and agreed to meet our friends at a second place. He wanted food, and then got upset with me because he thought I didn't want him to get food when I mentioned that there was food at the second place where our friends were waiting. He didn't talk to me or anyone the entire time at the second location. They kept asking me what was wrong with him. He drove like a psycho on the way to drop me off so I jumped out of the car at a stop sign and had to walk home a mile and a half in the freezing rain in heels. It snowed like 5 hours later. He popped a tire because of the way he was driving. We fought for a week.) \r\n\r\nI always want to think he isn't the jealous type, but I am realizing that I have mostly stopped attempting to have friendships with men unless they are someone he hits it off with, which is almost no one. He does not like most people. I have two brothers, and I have always had platonic male friends. \r\n\r\nI love my boyfriend. He loves animals like I do, and we have had so much fun together. He is so smart and absolutely hilarious. He can be the kindest man in the world, but his anger/control issues and insecurities are getting in our way. I'm not patient enough to cater to him, and I am tired of having to defend myself to someone that says he loves me. I told him I would stay to help him sort out his medications and work through therapy, but at what point does his mental illness justify the emotional abuse?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: My boyfriend saw a notification for a text from a (platonic) man friend I met on reddit and started a rapid fire interrogation about the extent of our relationship. \r\n\r\nAITA for getting mad at him for being jealous/insecure?\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: With help from all of you, I decided that I need to be a little more understanding and patient, but also that I need to stand my ground because I have not done anything wrong. I called him and we talked about it. I told him that I can understand that it looks bad, but then I explained that my feelings were hurt. I asked him to look beyond his anxiety and remember who he is speaking to because he knows me well enough to know that I would not do anything wrong. He acknowledged that the questioning was a bit much, and thanked me for trying to see it from his perspective. It was a productive conversation, and I think it's okay now. We both still need a little time to stop being annoyed with each other, but we were able to work it out.

I (26m) have this cousin (29m) whom I always had a lot in common. We have common interests, he was the one who got me started in some games I still play, some of the music I listen to, yada yada. However, he is one of the most insufferable people to live with and be around, because he has somewhat of an inflated ego, and is very petulant. You know, one of those guys that you always feel uncomfortable in the sense that you are treading carefully to not hurt his ego, otherwise he might snap at you or get upset. I lived with him for 1 year where he came to my city for university and stayed at our house (my family is living abroad, so it was only two of us), and we never got into an argument or a fight, because I always humbled and humored him. He is otherwise a smart and cool guy, but my points stand.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my cousin and my mom (his aunt - his mom's sister) had a sour relationship for the past couple of years. He at one time said some rude things to my mom which came out of nowhere. In another time that is unrelated, my mom said some very rude things about my aunt, my cousin and their family in general due to some inheritence dispute. My mom and aunt have long made up, but my mom and my cousin never really got along I guess. \r\n\r\nLast year, unbeknownst to me, my mom decided to apologize for saying rude things to them (probably was talked into it by my sister) and they bought them some gifts. Anyway, the gift my mom gave to my cousin was a moderately priced cool looking men's bracelet. So, earlier this year when I went visit my aunt, my cousin gifted me some stuff and out of nowhere, he also brought out a box with the bracelet in it, and said something along the lines of *\"actually you know what, take this too\"*. He said *someone gifted it to him, he never used it so you I could have it*. A couple months later, when my mom came to visit our country she saw the bracelet in my wrist and said *wait a second, this looks familiar* and proceeded to tell me about how they got it for my cousin originally. I took a photo and sent it to my sister abroad, and she confirmed it was that exact bracelet and even sent me caps of the original Amazon order. Naturally, my mom was upset and I too got angry because I felt **used** for my cousin to get back to my mom out of spite. I IM'd him to ask *what was the reason behind that move*, and he said *it was an honest gift, he thought nothing of it*. A day later, he called me and I didn't answer. And we haven't talked again to date.\r\n \r\nSo, I have two questions: \r\n1 - Is the move he did (gifting the gift to the gifter's son) an asshole move, given the context **and** otherwise?\r\n2 - AITA for using this as leverage to stop talking to him because I think he's insufferable?"}, "249": {"id": "eh61dq", "title": "WIBTA for cutting my grandmother off?", "body": "I (27F) was raised by my mother (48) \r\n\r\nI wasnt my mothers firstborn, at the age of 16 my mother gave birth to my sister; Skylar Lilian \r\n\r\nWhen Skylar was 5 she got sick, she didn't make it.\r\n\r\nMy mother is still devastated.\r\n\r\nNine weeks ago I welcomed a baby girl into the world, I called her Skylar after my sister.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother is 74, shes still very able bodied etc.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother  went into a rant about how I'm enabling my mothers grief after all this time etc, basically calling me an asshole for bringing my mothers grief up again.\r\n\r\nI've told my husband I want to cut her off, he thinks shes just old fashioned and I'd be an asshol\r\n\r\nMy mother flickers from loving the name to not being able to say it, she was happy when I named my child after my sister.\r\n\r\nWIBTA?"}, "250": {"id": "dgwlzf", "title": "WIBTA if I (22f) antagonized a grocery cashier (late20sF) who knowingly propositioned my boyfriend (20M) in front of both of us?", "body": "So there has been this cashier at my local small town corporate grocery store, we\u2019ll call her Rachel, who is...annoying.

I didn\u2019t say anything to her manager, and I don\u2019t know if I should have. But I am considering becoming a Problem Customer whenever I go through her check lane from now on. I\u2019ve never been a Karen (Let me talk to your manager) before, but I\u2019m considering it. \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I became a problem customer for the girl who tried to steal my boyfriend in front of me while she was ringing our groceries?\r\n\r\nEdit for info: I mean instead of speaking to her manager after the fact, having HER call the manager over during the transaction every time i go through her line and she\u2019s inappropriate and complaining to the manager in front of her."}}
