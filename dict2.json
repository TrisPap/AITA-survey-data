She asked me and her close friend (Kate) to be her bridesmaids, no one is maid of honor.\r\n\r\nSince I am a pastry chef she asked me if I would do the cakes (she wants multiple small ones instead of a big wedding cake), I of course happily agreed. She was ready to pay me but I said that in that case the cakes would be my wedding gift. I told her how exited I was to go with her and find her wedding dress and she told me that she wasn't doing that, she was just going to order a dress online since it's cheaper.

She said that she wanted to go with her fianc\u00e9 because she wanted his support. Again, kind of bummed but okay. This turned in to an argument because she thought I was an ass for pointing out what she had originally said and said that she's allowed to change her mind.\r\n\r\nYesterday she sent another picture of her in a store in a dress saying that she found the one.

I think in a lot of Europe it is less common? I happened to be in a room alone with her on the third day of the course and noticed she wasn't wearing a bra and was wearing a thin white t-shirt. I asked her if I could give her some advice and when she said yes I said I would recommend wearing bras at uni, especially when wearing white tops. I said how in the UK it was more normal for women to wear bras than to not and that she may get strange looks if she does not. We both know that some days we will be working up to 14 hours per day on stages under hot lights doing physical work. (Worth noting perhaps that we are not doing dance.) She said she would continue to wear what she wants and refernced women burning their bras. I agreed that I didn't think anyone could stop her and that she should wear what she feels comfortable in (I wear very informal clothes every day so I understand what it's like having ppl telling you what to wear.) Just before we left she asked if I thought the course tutors might mention it and I said I thought they probably would at some point.  which certainly seemed to surprise her.

The relationship lasted around 3 months and ended because of Sarah's various mental health issues that caused her to be pretty toxic and controlling towards Mike. They made up a few weeks after breaking up and are friends now, but Sarah is still not over the relationship and gets jealous quite easily, especially now that Mike has started dating someone new. \r\n\r\nNow on to me and my situation. I (F22) have not celebrated any of my birthdays since I was 16 and thought I'd might want to start doing that again. I found a nice karaoke bar that isn't too expensive and fairly close to where I live so I figured I'd invite everyone there, bring some cupcakes, say the first two rounds of drinks are on me, and have a fun night out with friends. Nothing big or fancy. Here's the problem: Sarah has a bit of a problem with alcohol. I wouldn't go as far as calling her am alcoholic but she certainly has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol that's linked to her various mental health problems. Just recently, her excessive drinking caused her to end up spending a couple of days locked up at a mental hospital, something that she said was a horrible experience that she doesnt ever want to repeat, yet at the same time not enough to get her to quit drinking. A few similar but less extreme situations later, she told me she was done drinking but tbh I'm not really convinced this will last too long, and neither do our mutual friends. Maybe this makes me the asshole but that's not what I'm asking.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that by the time my birthday comes along, she will be back to her old destructive patterns and excessive drinking. Since I know how she gets when she's drunk, I'd like to avoid that at my party, especially since Mike will be there and will serve as a catalyst for Sarah's mental breakdowns. Because of this, I wanna ask her to abstain from alcohol at the party and stick to non alcoholic beverages. Of course I have no way of enforcing this except for the drinks I'm buying as she could always buy her own drinks and I can't kick her out of a public bar but at least that way I will have communicated my wishes to her. \r\n\r\nI personally don't drink, so Sarah wouldn't be the only sober person there but I'm still worried she'll feel singled out as most of my other guests will probably have at least one drink that evening, as they all know their limits and are chill drunks that are fun to be around. Sarah feels attacked quite easily and I don't want to hurt her feelings as she is already very emotionally vulnerable. Would I be the asshole if I told her not to drink so that she won't ruin my first birthday in years?\r\n\r\nEdit: are karaoke bars different in the US? Because every karaoke bar I've been to is centred around karaoke, not alcohol. Like, yeah, karaoke bars serve alcohol but so do restaurants and cafes.

I feel like he puts a shield because he does not want to be hurt or let down and only wants to put his faith in his family.\r\n\r\nHis girlfriend lives in a different state and only visits a couple times a year.  We have hung out together once.\r\n\r\nAfter asking him when he was going to propose to his girlfriend he begins to joke around \" we broke up\" \" she doesn't like me anymore\".  I said can you stop saying that unless its true, I will message her and find out!  He didn't talk about his girlfriend for about a month.  At lunch the other day he begins to joke around again saying oh yeah I proposed.  Me and my other coworkers say \" really! that is awesome\".  \" I'm only joking, I didn't\"  This goes on back and forth about the proposal, ring, when, where and he joked back and forth and we came out of the conversation not really knowing what to believe.  I told him i would message GF if he didn't stop joking around, he said \" go ahead!\"  So I messaged her and she said \" yes he did propose, and I said yes!\"  I told her congratulations and maybe we could celebrate when she comes up next, she said of course and thank you.\r\n\r\nThe next day, he says he was joking again.  It wasn't brought up for 3 days.  Today another coworker of 2 years that also considers herself a close friend with him told him to knock it off and be serious.  After she harassed him for about 10 minutes, he finally says \" yeah i proposed 2 months ago\" showed us a couple pictures that indeed verified it. He said I'm not TA.\r\n\r\nI feel hurt that he wouldn't share any of this process with his closest friend, but even that fact it took 2 months and someone else badgering him to finally admit it.\r\n\r\nSo AITAH for caring to be informed about this significant moment in his life?\r\n\r\nEDIT: It seems like I got the response I needed to hear.

I'll describe the event that was the catalyst to our break up. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIt was during exam period for university. 3 days before my first exam, we went on a casual date to the local mall. I thought it would be good to meet up and release some of our stress. We had Chinese noodles for lunch. While eating, we got talking. I was telling her about a YouTube video I watched the other day. It was an informative speech made by a psychologist about cheating. The psychologist explained most cheaters don't go out of their way to cheat. And when it happens, most people are surprised they're doing it themselves. It's almost unexpected. She also explained how cheating has existed for a very long time where we probably won't be able to get rid of it as a social condition. I felt I learned a different perspective of cheating and thought to share this to my gf at the time. I didn't notice anything wrong straight away. The meal continued as normal and we talked about different things as well. When we finished the meal, we paid and proceeded to browse the shops. She got progressively worse and when I asked her what was wrong it was like she was having an anxiety attack. She wouldn't talk to me for the remainder of the date and we walked out of the mall back to the car. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nOne the way back and in the car, I occasionally tried to start up a conversation but she felt silent. I was growing more flustered and had no idea what was going on. She began by questioning me and asking me questions about cheating. I answered and was thinking through the topic as well. It's safe to say I have never thought about some of the questions she asked me in a proper and serious manner. Especially considering how flustered I became, the environment where we had this talk wasn't calm in the least. Our discussion kept on going around in a circle and it felt like she wasn't listening to me at all and only feeding into her own fear. She kept on brushing off everything I said and wasn't taking it in at all. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nShe finally asked me \"Would you ever cheat on me?\" Part of me knew obviously to say \"No.\" Even if I agreed or disagreed, I understand feelings are still important. The other half wanted to stay true to me and my way of thinking. I was thinking about what the lady said in the video and how things can just happen. I also didn't want to say a promise I couldn't keep. In the end I chose to say something along the lines of not answering with a firm no. Something like \"I cannot promise you that\". She got very sad and upset. That was the last time we ever talked in person. I sent a very long apology text later that night after thinking it through. I knew I had hurt her. However, I wanted to explain my side and how I couldn't betray myself and my way of thinking. Unfortunately she couldn't understand my perspective. She explained how she couldn't forgive me for saying something like that."}, "266": {"id": "ckqgby", "title": "AITA for rescinding parental access to my daughter when my ex-wife got a pitbull?", "body": "39M is me, 37F is my ex-wife, we have a daughter 4F.

She did a good job at inviting me to outings with her and her friends. But slowly (about 2 weeks into me being there) she started to have her new bf around more. Come to find out her new bf is her ex fianc\u00e9es groomsmen. Her and her new bf got together shortly after she broke it off with her ex. They all share a friend group so she asked me to be discreet and downplay the relationship around friends so they wouldn\u2019t suspect anything. \r\n\r\nAfter 2-3 months of living there and having him secretly being there too every so often, it moved to them being public about the relationship. Which led to him being over every day and spending every night here. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the house is a split level so I have the basement, she has the upstairs which opens to the kitchen which we share. The laundry room is also downstairs which has been awkward as he\u2019s come down to do laundry at night when I\u2019m relaxing and has gone as far to ask me to move it from washer to dryer and double check it\u2019s dry when done. \r\n\r\nSo out of not wanting to stir the pot ive let new bf stay at our place every night and take our travel mugs and leave multiple pairs of shoes out in the kitchen because I thought she might be rebounding. \r\n\r\nAs you might\u2019ve guessed they\u2019re still spending as much as time possible together 7 months later and he\u2019s all but moved his couch over here.

She did say that she could go to his apartment (literally 2 minutes down the road) during the day on the weekend but that he will continue to stay here every night because she has dogs. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m going back and forth about if I have a leg to stand on here; asking that he either not be here every night or she lower my rent to account for an additional tenant. \r\n\r\nTLDR: the girl I rent from owns the house and her bf has 90% moved in and stays every night with us. I asked if she would be okay with him not spending more than half the week here or lowering my rent.

I specifically chose this apartment because it had a room with a queen bed and enough space for my boyfriend to come down and visit and be comfortable. I mentioned to Alison before moving in that I had a bf that would be visiting me and acted like this wasn\u2019t an issue. The apartment is a two bedroom with a living space that has been converted into a flex room.\r\n\r\nFast forward and I move in and my boyfriend comes down to visit me. Now the first time he came I mentioned he was coming and made sure he was out of sight the entire time, she kind of responded in a weird way when I told her which surprised me because I warned her before moving in. The problem is Alison lives in the flex room of the apartment and can hear almost everything. I have another roommate but she has an actual room so it doesn\u2019t affect her at all. I forgot to tell her one day that he would be in town and Alison just so happened to be cleaning in the kitchen when my bf was getting out of the shower, I knew she was purposely cleaning just to catch him. She was pretty cool about the situation and just asked that she knew he was here each time he came. At first I made attempts to tell her when he was coming by but at this point I don\u2019t and I can tell it\u2019s bothering  her. The reason I don\u2019t tell her is bc she is becoming super petty with other stuff  and will obnoxiously talk shit about me and the other roommate (22F). I want to tell her to grow up and move out if she can\u2019t stand the noise anymore she is 30 for goodness sake. Me and my other roommate pay more for privacy and she pays a lot less.

Lately he has been doing it more and more, every time out of pure necessity I say something. Last night we were having dinner together at his apartment. Every time he took a bite he would scrape his teeth. Now I realize now he was doing this to just get a rise out of me. But I don\u2019t think he realizes how much something so little affects me. After listening to him do this for 5 minutes I broke down and told he needed to stop scraping his teeth or I was walking out do the apartment.

Our mother isn't in the picture and hasn't been since we were young. Our dad (64M) passed away a few weeks ago from longterm health complications, and I was shocked to discover that he had left almost everything to me in his will, including investments in various stocks/bonds/other assets and a significant amount of cash. He left John one small sentimental item, a guitar he used to play for us when we were little.\r\n\r\nDad and I had a great relationship, while his relationship with John was much more strained. He was the kind of person who believed in tough love and had high expectations for both of us. I know he didn't like a lot of my brother's life choices (he got poor grades in school, dropped out of college his freshman year, and was directionless for a long time before finding a stable job), while I excelled academically and have been fairly successful in my chosen career path. I can only make assumptions as to why Dad wanted to divide his will this way, and this is the best guess I have.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, this is a life-changing amount of money. Dad always lived frugally and worked hard, and he made some solid investments. My husband and I crunched the numbers, and if we invest responsibly, we could both retire now. We've been wanting to start a family, and this could give both us and our future children a life we could never have dreamed of otherwise.\r\n\r\nJohn and I aren't close at all, but we talk occasionally and get along fine whenever we do see each other. I know he was deeply hurt when he found out how Dad had divided up our inheritance. He has not asked me to split my portion with him, but I can tell he's really bothered by the situation.\r\n\r\nI loved my dad very much, and because of that, I'm reluctant to go against his last wishes. He may have had valid reasons for not sharing the money with John that I know nothing about. But at the same time, while my brother isn't the most driven/responsible guy, he is also not a bad person, and I obviously wouldn't be posting here if I didn't have any doubts about this decision.\r\n\r\n**Edit: I would like to thank everyone for the feedback I've received. I want you to know that I've read all of your\u00a0comments, every single one, and I appreciate all of the perspectives,\u00a0thoughts, and advice you've provided. As I posted above, I would not be here\u00a0if I didn't feel troubled or conflicted by this situation.**\r\n\r\n**I have no more answers than any of you as to why this happened. I don't know if Dad wanted to teach John some sort of lesson, if he didn't think he would be responsible with the money, or if he just thought he didn't deserve it. Maybe he wrote the will in anger after an argument. Maybe he regretted not changing it before he died. Maybe he did it for all of these reasons, or for none of them. I don't know, and I don't think I'll ever know for sure. John swears he doesn't know why Dad made this decision, and I'm going to take him at his word.**\u00a0\r\n\r\n**After a lot of reflection, I have decided to go with\u00a0the most charitable possible interpretation of the will, which is that Dad meant for both of us to split his\u00a0estate evenly but wanted me to be the one to distribute the money and make sure John uses it\u00a0wisely. So that's what I'm going to do.** \r\n\r\n**I will give John 50 percent of everything I received. I'm going to set up an appointment with an attorney to figure out the best way to do this, because I know there will be a lot of taxes involved if I gift it all at once. Setting up some sort of trust for him may be a better option. The remaining half of the estate will still give my husband and me a significant head start on an early retirement if we continue to work hard and save. It will just be a bit later down the line.**\r\n\r\n**I don't know what else to say. This has all been so difficult to process, and it's all wrapped up in this very raw, different sort of grief, the kind that comes from knowing someone you loved was maybe not the person you thought they were. My God. In some ways, that's a thousand times more painful than knowing that he's gone.**\u00a0"}, "284": {"id": "c9o0sv", "title": "WIBTA if I sold my dead grandmother\u2019s wedding ring?", "body": "My grandmother passed away last year and she left some of her grandchildren her most expensive jewellery and left me (20, f) her very expensive wedding ring.

None of us are close with Sandy but as its a relatively small office, we all know her name.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Rich said something to me (I don\u2019t remember the comment verbatim) to the effect of \u201cI know we\u2019re at work but if you think that\u2019ll spare you from birthday punches, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Rich, Brian, and I all laughed. Not for one single second did I think Rich was threatening me. Sandy didn\u2019t say anything.\r\n\r\nUNTIL I got a call from HR to come in to their office. I go in and the HR director asks if I\u2019m okay and if there\u2019s anything I want to tell her. I said no. She told me that she received a complaint about an incident where Rich made a threat against me. I was shocked and adamantly told her that it was a joke and I didn\u2019t feel threatened at all.

I haven't heard anything from her since.\r\n\r\nOf course when I got back to my cubicle, I texted Rich and Brian about what happened. We figured it was Sandy who made the complaint because she was the only one in the kitchen. We didn\u2019t confront her or anything (even though Rich wanted to... i thought it would be a bad look and possibly look like retaliation but maybe he was right?). But Rich was never even called into HR despite anxiously awaiting a call.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to today. Rich, Brian, and I were all in the kitchen this morning when Sandy came in.

Dad moved back to the parents\u2019 home country to work when I was very young and older brother wasn\u2019t home a lot because of the military and school. Mom and I always had a rough relationship because of our complicated family situation (abuse, mental illness). We didn\u2019t talk to each other much even if both of us were home.\r\n\r\nOne day, Mom tells me she was diagnosed with cancer and that she\u2019ll be making a sudden trip to the home country for medical care. She gets a second diagnosis from the doctors there who tell her it\u2019s a benign tumor, she gets it removed, and then makes the decision to live in the home country with my dad to receive medical care there. I\u2019m still a student with no stable income, so she said that Dad will support me financially while I live in the house alone, and this was a huge lifestyle change for me because I had never lived alone before, but I ended up liking the solitude a lot.\r\n\r\nISSUE: Mom came back to the US for a couple months and at this time, things were still kinda tense between us. One morning, I woke up but stayed in bed to be a potato for a bit. Something about me is that I cannot do anything immediately after I wake up, I have to have some time to fully wake up and get in the mood to be productive before I do anything. I get up to go to the bathroom (still in my sleep shirt and undies), Mom catches me as I leave the bathroom, and tells me to do something. I instantly get annoyed, and I admit, gave her some attitude, but still did it anyway.\r\n\r\nNext, I receive a text from my brother. Brother said my mom complained to him about my attitude. This instantly makes me furious because 1) she complained to my brother instead of just confronting me about it and 2) of course I\u2019m gonna be annoyed if I\u2019m told to do something when I\u2019ve just woken up and am still half naked. I confronted her about this, and she goes off on me saying that I should\u2019ve done what she told me to do a long time ago (and this was something that she told me to do maybe a few days to a week ago, but I just never got around to it.) I say that I would\u2019ve been more receptive to doing it without complaints or attitude if maybe she asked me to politely, but instead she commanded me to do it. This escalates into a fight so I give up trying to communicate and leave the house.\r\n\r\nI admit, I grew up a spoiled brat. I got almost everything I wanted as a child and I was never expected to do chores. So maybe that part of me that\u2019s still a spoiled brat reacted badly to my mom simply telling me to do something that I should\u2019ve done without attitude or complaints. But at the same time, I grew up with my mom constantly taking out her anger (from my dad\u2019s abuse) on me, and I grew up very fearful of her and resented her for a long time for her poor parenting. \r\n\r\nSo, AITA?"}, "287": {"id": "d9ak4h", "title": "WIBTA If I reported my HS Counselor for being insensitive about my mental illness", "body": "UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who commented, I truly appreciate it.

Honestly, watching people hash it out in the comment section about accommodated tests taking environment made me question if I wanted the accommodation.

I spoke with my mom and she agreed that what he said was insensitive and said she would speak to him.\r\n\r\nLater in the day he called me into his office and he asked me if there was anything we needed to talk about and I again told him point blank that what he said offended me and he said that he was sorry for offending me, again i asked him point blank if he was sorry i was offended or sorry he offended me. He told me straight up, \u201cI am not sorry for what I said, i am not going to argue with you, you are misinterpreting my words and that\u2019s that.\u201d The conversation ended there and again I left crying.\r\n\r\nI told my mom that i want an honest apology from him otherwise i would take the matter to someone of higher authority.

Initially, I agreed to go as I just turned 21 and a Las Vegas trip with friends sounded fun. I agreed to go and even offered to help plan the trip out a bit. I agreed to go on the trip in early August. We then began to delve into the ticket and housing prices which would be \\~$300-350 for three days and on top of that I would have to spend money on food and other activities. I then decided that it was too expensive of a trip/not a trip I\u2019d like to spend that much money on.

We spontaneously decided to buy the plane tickets and booked our housing situation. We also all agreed that we wanted it to be a lowkey trip with only us three guys. We agreed to not tell anyone else about this trip just to simplify things. Of course there is a huge possibility that people will eventually find out about the trip. I know if Alex were to find out about my Las Vegas trip with Rob and John (who were also invited to Alex\u2019s 21st birthday trip, but declined to go from the get go), he would be extremely hurt (more by me than Rob and Alex I would guess), so I am heavily leaning towards not telling Alex about the trip at all.

I had a lot of free time at her place, the least I could do was pick up her chores which included: laundry(I drive to a separate laundry mat), cook, wash dishes, grocery shopping, and clean house. Whatever that needed to be done, I did. I did all of this while my apartment was being paid for.\r\n\r\nAbout a month ago I finally got a part time job at a kitchen. I now had income and was planning to use it to start paying for my apartment because I didn\u2019t want my parents to be paying for it anymore. I told my girlfriend of my plans and ended up getting into a heated argument because she thought I was going to start paying her rent. I was willing to give her about $250 because that\u2019s about half of my rent. Then I found out that I had to start paying my student loans. I\u2019m making about $2 above minimum wage while my girlfriend is making about 50% more. Rent for my apartment is close to 55-60% of my income.

I am white. \r\n\r\nYesterday, I was spending the night at my girlfriend's place. She lives in a duplex and has lived beside the same neighbors for two years. They aren't friends but are friendly. \r\n\r\nThe neighbors had people over and were playing loud music and we could hear them. It wasn't a huge issue but it went on past 10pm. I told my girlfriend that I was going to talk to them but she told me not to because they had actually come to her a few days before to ask if it would be alright for them to host a birthday party at their house, knowing it would go late and she'd be able to hear it because of how thin the walls are. GF is a hard sleeper when it comes to sound so the noise wasn't really bothering her. I'm a light sleeper. She forgot about the party when we discussed me sleeping over. \r\n\r\nShe told me she wouldn't be upset if I chose to go home but it was late and I didnt want to drive. I told her I was going over to speak with them. She decided to go herself. She comes back and they turn the volume on the music down and quiet down to a respectable level. \r\n\r\nMidnight rolls around and they volume has slowly risen back to it's original volume (the music stayed low but I could hear their conversation). GF doesn't wake up so I decide to call the police since they'd been warned. They show up about a half hour later. The flashing lights of the police car through the windows wakes up girlfriend.\r\n\r\nShe asks if I called the police and I confirm that I did. She gets incredibly angry and tells me that as soon as the officer leaves, I need to get out of her house. I ask her why and she tells me that she and I have had the discussion before that she doesn't believe in calling the police on other black people if no one is in danger and that, as a guest in her home, I should have respected that. She was also angry because she says I had the opportunity to go back to my own place earlier in the night when it was apparent the noise level that they had already cleared with her, was going to disturb my sleep. \r\n\r\nI told her I would leave but that she was being ridiculous and that if her neighbors couldn't be quiet after she asked them to then the next logical step was to get the police involved. \r\n\r\nShe refused to have any further discussion with me and, once the police left after making everyone who didnt live in the other side of the duplex leave, she made me leave around 2am even though she knew I had work this morning. \r\n\r\nI've tried calling and texting her but the only response I got was a text telling me that she needed to evaluate if she could trust me to take issues in her community seriously and she needed some space to do it.\r\n\r\nI still think I was right and it was inconsiderate of her to make me drive back to my own place so late. \r\nSo, AITA?"}, "325": {"id": "cdphus", "title": "AITA for rejecting the invitation to my boyfriend\u2019s family dinner?", "body": "My boyfriend(23M) and I (24F) became official 6 days ago and we were seeing each other for 4 months prior.

My family has never been rich people, and as a family of 6 my siblings, parents, and I made do on around $70,000 a year for nearly 20 years in the increasingly expensive greater Seattle area. It should be noted here that we live modestly and within our means. Despite that, due to rising cost of living in the area for the majority of the time we lived paycheck to paycheck and have never been able to set much money aside. I (20M) started doing odd jobs when I was 13 and have worked nearly every week since then to afford the few luxuries I do have, most of which serve another purpose (my laptop for school and work for example). And while I have some, my savings are minimal. I dropped out of high school when I was 16 because I was dealing with some personal issues and because let's be honest, the public school system sucks. I used that time to better myself as a person and continue working. More recently I got into a program that allows me to attend local community college classes essentially for free and by the time I turn 21 I will have my associates degree and not have paid a dime. This is important as I now have attended a year of college entirely for free and I nor my parents has paid a dime for it. Never before did I think I would be able to attend college simply because if the cost.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future I have a good chance at getting into one of the in-state universities and have decided to go for my Ph.D in psychology as I happen to be pretty suited to the field. My father, recently quit his job of 20 years and started his own business, and in half a year has made well over the 70k/year he had made for the past 20 years. After doing the math and adjusting for the increase in university costs over the next 7 years or so I managed to approximate the total cost of my attendance to just under $200,000. I'll be knocking some of this down with scholarships and grants, but a significant chunk is still going to need to be taken out in student loans. None of my siblings ever went to college and never showed any interest in attending college, they all now live out of state and have started their own lives. With my father's newfound increase in funding I accept that I am selfish, but AITA for wanting him to help pay for some of my university costs so I don't need to take as much out in student loans?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: my father is now making significantly above what he used to, I have managed to attend 2 years of college classes without asking for a dime, AITA for wanting my parents to help subsidize my university costs?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI would like to clarify a few things that seem to have become the main point of contention here. \r\n\r\nI do not, nor have I ever felt entitled to anything from my parents and have always worked for everything I now own as an adult. Likewise I do not feel entitled to any money so perhaps this should have been titled \"WIBTA if\" I apologize if how I phrased things made me seem entitled to it, my only intention was to give as much information as possible as this is my first post on this sub.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the program I'll be going to for my bachelor's is set up to prep you for the school's Ph.D program, I have no idea why they do it like that, they just do.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, following advice on having an adult conversation, I asked my father somewhat nonchalantly  a few minutes ago as we were getting lunch together and he said that once he moves into a smaller house next year he would be more than happy to help subsidize some of my costs so I wouldn't have nearly the amount of debt I calculated when I graduated.\r\n\r\nBest regards to everyone on the sub, thanks for the advice on my anxiety provoking issue, I was nervous to ask as historically asking for money has been something of a no-go in my family due to the aforementioned financial constraints and I was raised to never accept handouts."}, "328": {"id": "cr1mi2", "title": "AITA for going to lunch with an ex?", "body": "Hi friends - hope this doesn\u2019t break the \u201cno relationships\u201d rule.

The pranks ranged in complexity from simply covering one friends room in toilet paper to staging a fake argument over the entirety of a week that would ultimately culminate in a fake fight with fake blood.\r\n\r\nAll of the pranks had gone well and the last of the pranks, which turned out to be our crown jewel, took aim at our good friend G. A little background G had been having sex with this girl and confided in us that one night, when he was drunk, the condom slipped of his dick and he was terrified he had gotten the girl pregnant. The strange part about this fear was that he hadnt even managed to cum from the sex so there shouldve been no worry (this turned out to be important later on). So as our last prank of the week, we decided to use a throwaway number from google voice to give him a call from \"the pregnancy clinic.\" Bird made the call and, although I dont remember exactly what was said, the conversation was something along the lines of \"(Name of the girl he fucked) just got in results that she's pregnant. She wanted us to give you a call and inform you that you're the father. Would you be willing to attend appointments with her?\" Note all of this was said by Bird in a pretty bad British accent to throw him off the scent. Also note that this call was made ON April Fool's day. Much to our surprise he bought it hookline and sinker. His tone became resolute and solemn, saying that he would step up and become the father he was meant to be. We reveal our prank and have a great laugh.\r\n\r\nLater that night G comes into our dorm looking very down. He confides in us that we tapped into one of his greatest fears. At the time he received the call, he was in the dining hall and had a mini panic attack. He said everything began to spin and he blacked out contemplating the call he would have to make to his mother to expalin the situation. He ended up in the dining hall bathroom throwing up for a bit afterwards. He told us he would rather have been kicked in the balls.\r\n\r\nSo reddit AITA for being so damn good at pranks?\r\n\r\ntldr; Room mate and I went on a prank spree culminating in a fake call from a pregnancy center to another friend on April Fool's day, causing him to think his worst fear has been realized and have a mini panic attack.\r\n\r\n"}, "333": {"id": "eteu5d", "title": "AITA for telling my friends my brother got stressed because he didn't study for a test?", "body": "Okay so a little history.

However, I also told them that when we travel, I insist that wherever we stay hads enough bedrooms that each of my boys can have their own room.

I also said that if finding a big enough place was outside of their budget, I would gladly contribute to the cost of the accommodations.\r\n\r\nThe kids having their own rooms is very important to me.

I (18F) am a freshman at a local university, around an hour from where my parents currently reside. I'm living in a dorm this year due to a freshman residency requirement, but my parents and I initially had plans for me to move off campus into an apartment next year. However, my parents decided to sit me down at a restaurant and outline the reasons which I was not allowed to live off campus, and why I would need to commute to school next year.\r\n\r\nTheir main reasons were:\r\n\r\nFinances, they cannot afford the costs an apartment would require\r\n\r\nThey do not trust me to live on my own, due to my prior history of mental health disorders (specifically an eating disorder, they accused me of \"sticking my finger down my throat in a college bathroom\" because they disapprove of my current weight (130, healthy for a 5'9\" and 18 year old girl)\r\n\r\nI tried to provide my own counterargument:\r\n\r\n1. It's not that they don't have the finances, as they are very wealthy. They were willing to bail my brother out for a felony, but an apartment is unreasonable? Financial aid offers backfired, and I was rejected from scholarships and loans (could not lend private at the time). The flat is shared with a roommate and 800 a month, cheap for the area, and cheaper than the dorm (including the meal plan I cannot use).\r\n2. They claimed they did not trust me to live on my own due to my history of mental health disorders (anorexia & severe social anxiety). I argued that my weight as dropping because accommodations from school have consisted of very low calorie meals, that are not sustainable (chicken and rice, mostly). No shit my weight is going to be plummeting, I can't eat anything here. My parents do not take celiac seriously, and accused me of making up fears of cross contamination and for attention, and when I try to prepare safe food in my home kitchen, I am mocked and contaminated due to their negligence. Not ideal, hence why I would prefer to have my own kitchen in an apartment. I was coerced into signing over my medical rights, and must have them present in the office after they accused me of lying to doctors in privacy and threatened to pull me out of school if I didn't sign.  I've been trying to find a job to cover my expenses, but there's no place I could work that would accommodate my schedule (classes until 8pm), and my anxiety disorders (got fired from my last job after I blacked out in front of a customer due to anxiety).

I think the profiles are wild and fun and enjoy reading them. So, after several months without the app, I redownloaded it. I told my gf that I was going to make a profile, the first line of my bio says that I'm in a monogamous relationship, and I told her I would include a photo of us together if she was comfortable with that. (I also said I would let her look through it wherever she wanted).\r\n\r\nOriginally, she said this was fine and told me to send her funny quotes from the profiles. She said she trusted me and knew I was not looking to cheat. However, she has backtracked and now says she's uncomfortable but doesn't want to control me. \r\n\r\nI don't want to upset her, but I have a lot of fun looking at these profiles and don't think I'm doing anything wrong. To me, this is no different then going to a bar or club without my gf; sure I could meet someone but that's not what I'm there for, I'm there for entertainment. My gf and I have talked about being okay with each other dancing with other girls, and going out and understand we might be hit on,  we don't see that as cheating.

I remade an account this morning and was only on the app for about 15 minutes before work. \r\n\r\n2. I had no matches and only had the app for a few hours before she texted a large paragraph about how she originally said it was fine but now felt uncomfortable. I didn't write this because I was ignoring her feelings, I was confused because in my eyes nothing had changed since I only had the app on my phone for a short time\r\n\r\n3. The part about going to clubs/bars was added because she enjoys partying and dancing with other girls, I'm more of a home body but when I go out I dance with my friends and sometimes people who join the group. We both discussed the etiquette for going out- what was okay and what was cheating- and both are fine with dancing and flirting. My point was, why is dancing with girls okay but having a tinder profile not?\r\n\r\n4. I reached out to talk more in depth but since we both work and can't speak until tonight I wanted input from y'all. I know I need to get better at seeing things from different perspectives and I understand now why the app makes people uncomfortable, I'm just still confused about why the app is considered cheating but clubbing isn't (per our previous convos)\r\n\r\nEither way I accept that I'm TA and will apologize to her"}, "341": {"id": "e0a16b", "title": "AITA for telling my study buddy the harsh truth?", "body": "Hello, bit of background information for starters.\r\n\r\nI (18M) and this girl (17F) are taking a Biology course together, she seemed pretty well invested in studying and serious about it and seeing as I am, too, she asked me if we could study together every once in a while, to which I agreed.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 3 weeks we ended up bonding beyond this 'biology study buddies' thing, and I'm suspecting she may have feelings for me.\r\n\r\nWe sat for the first exam one week ago, she was freaking out and was so stressed out about it and despite having studied together for most of it, I couldn't bring her to calm down.

Originally, 1 was my sister's (30f) and 2 were mine.   As a result of my and my sister's life changes, the cats now live with our mother.  She loves them, has claimed them as her own, and has made it clear that we aren't getting any cats back.  That is fine with both my sister and me - we are grateful for her taking the cats when we couldn't and we still get to see them when we visit. \r\n\r\nHowever, the cats do not get along.  They generally ignore/tolerate each other, but have little growling, clawing spats on a daily basis.  My mother all too often gets in the middle and gets hurt.  One cat (one of my former cats) is particularly prone to scratching and biting, not just when provoked by the other cats.  If you pet her wrong or just get in her way you're liable to get nipped. \r\n\r\nIt's been twice now that the cat has bit my mom really bad - deep puncture marks in her arm.  The critical detail here is that as a result of cancer surgery, she no longer has lymph nodes in her right arm, the arm that has received both bites.   The first bite sent her to the hospital for 3 days, her arm swollen triple it's normal size, as they administered IV antibiotics and monitored her to make sure her body could actually fight the infection.  The doctor scolded her, \"you could lose a hand. \"  Fortunately, the second time wasn't so bad, but that doesn't mean the third time couldn't cost her a limb.\r\n\r\nMy mom's solution is to try and remember to reach out with her left arm.  She loves the dang cat and feels like a round of antibiotics is worth keeping it around.  I don't think she fully, consciously, realizes how much of a real threat to her safety the cat, unfortunately, is.  I feel like the cat is an extreme liability and am having trouble in good conscience doing nothing.  I want to respect the wishes of a grown woman, I don't want to piss off my mom, but most of all I don't want to let her get hurt, again."}, "351": {"id": "9v8umv", "title": "AITA for not letting my boyfriend take our son too far away from me to his parents or other places", "body": "Hello everyone, I would like your opinion on this matter as I am at my wits end lately. My bf (m32) and me (f30) have a son (19m) together. \r\n\r\nIt has always been a rocky relationship and our son was not planned but very much welcomed by me and the bf didn't want him, had abortion in mind but when he realized I was keeping him no matter what (I told him it was his decision alone and I would accept whatever he wanted to do and make it work that way for the 3 of us, everything from not being in his life to continuing on living together) he decided to stay. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWe have different backgrounds. He has 5 other siblings, his mom is somewhat NOT a housewife (despite having 6 children weird right?), he has not been raised to be a fucntioning adult. The kids always were on their own as mom decided to go work when the youngest one was a year old and dad was always away at work as well. \r\n\r\nSo these kids, are all nice people, but have not gotten any proper bringing up. Rules, consequences, and especially cleanliness were never an issue at that home. There was a lot of lying to get out of trouble. I understand, that that is what happens when you leave 5 little kids mostly to their own and I try to understand when the bf lies or does not clean up properly. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI was raised by a mom who went to boarding school for 2 years to learn how to be a housekeeper (but for the industrial sector meaning she was employed mostly in say old people homes and the like). \r\n\r\nI have a brother who is 9 years older so I was raised mostly as a single child one would say but I learned to share and all that as my brother obviously was there we just didn't have much in common. \r\n\r\nI was raised to make my own doctors appointments instead of just letting the issue get worse and worse, was raised to look after my posseions propery, to take care of things and clean them and keep a clean house (and when I say clean I mean just clean, not sparkling, not perfect, but clean). There were rules at my house, simple ones, f.e. homework had to be done before doing anything else. \r\n\r\nMy mom was and is a very patient, loving person who always discussed situations with me and taught me to talk about things that were going on and she taught me how to handle my emotions and share them. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nBf and I met, fell in love and 2 yrs later I got pregnant. The first year and especially the first months were very, very, very, extremely hard on us and me especially. My bf never learned to show sympathy. I had had a horrible birth (I thought the baby was dead and I was going to die) and a hard time breastfeeding, the baby would scream a lot and never sleep and I was a wreck. I knew I \"signed up\" for it, but I think so did my bf when he decided he would stay. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow comes the part that bothers me. He does not take proper care of our son. He never has. I wanted to trust him, from the start, but he always messed up somehow. I could recite a thousand things where he put my baby, our baby, into serious danger. I can very well say that that kid is just lucky that nothing bad has happened to him yet while being in the care of his father. I have talked and talked and talked to him about child safety. We even had a special midwife assigned to us from 8 weeks on as I was getting worse and worse and needed help and wanted a professional to be there whenever I had questions. My mom sadly does work a lot and is rarely there to ask. His parents were no option as they live too far away. Even our midwife told him repeatedly what to do and what not to do. He never listened. He had no bad intentions but he simply, imo, thinks \"oh well things will be okay\". \r\n\r\nThere was a situation were, we would bathe our son and then dry him of A LITTLE with a blow dryer, his feet especially as he hated being touched there to dry him off and we didn't want any fungus problems. The midwife told us to be very careful, as babies, especially boys, have died because of electrocution from peeing into the blow dryer. So I made Sure to always put a towel around babys privates to prevent this. The bf never bothered which bothered me. In that one situation, he took care of our son after bathing and when I came into the bathroom he turned around, lifted the running blow dryer up, luckily, because right then the baby started peeing. I was mortified to say the least. I practically saved that kid from getting electrocuted. He had not used a towel on him. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nOur son has hit his head so hard on our coffe table that he chipped of a front tooth at 8 months because his dad couldn't be bothered to look what he was doing and he had just begun to stand and hold onto things. I heard the hit and my bf was lying on the ground facing into the opposite direction of the baby. I was livid. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThis summer I saved our son from falling down into a concrete pit, as he was standing on the ledge ALONE while his father was off talking to friends, having left our son out of his sight. If my baby would have fallen a certain way he could have broke an arm, a leg, or done serious harm to his face. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend almost drowned as a kid because his mom left him with his older brother at age 5 and 6 alone at a public pool and he couldn't yet swim right! Because she had to go \"take care\" of the other kids. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy father in law once thought it was appropriate to hand my 6 month old son a lid of a honey jar! My mother in law was sick with the flu, did not tell us, let us come over for \"tea\" and spent the day on the couch coughing into my sons general direction, then went on to give my bf a brown, dried up, top part of a lemon squeezer she probably coughed onto as well while making hot lemon tea with it, to play PLAY for my son with and CHEW on it! She thought it was a great idea and so did my bf! This all happened while I was out for 2 minutes taking a bathroom break. I had JUST explained 30 minutes before, that we had started feeding him solids and were taking it very slow with introducing new food as my family is prone to allergies. Also no one in that damn family knows about the dangers of honey for a 6 month old. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy father in law also doesn't listen to what I say. Our son reacts extremely to sugary food. If we give him anything, like a yoghurth with sugar in it, he will go berserk for hours. Hyperactivity due to sugar consumption. So my boyfriends parents were over for coffee and cake and I said our son could have a little cake because, of course, he will want the same food we eat. No biggie. Let the child have some cake. But the FIL spent his time feeding our son his little slice of cake while he could have eaten it very much on his own, so my fil's cake was still there when we were done. And he kept on feeding him with his cake and I said no. My bf stuck to his dads side and said a little more won't hurt. Then WENT AND GOT MORE CAKE FOR OUR SON. I said I don't want him to eat THAT much sugar, my fil dryly said \"well you could make a cake with less sugar in it the next time I won't mind.\" I was furious. Again. My son can have cake. But a child sized portion and not his grandpas slice as well. Of course that night my son went to sleep at 10pm instead of 7pm. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nOur latest arguments were about:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\- my bf allowing our son to handle our extremely sharp knifes while sitting in his high chair and eating. Of course our boy wants to \"cut\" things now and he is welcome to, but with a childrens knife. No my bf lets him take our sharp adult knifes. And of course our son cut himsellf with one of them. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\- my bf giving our son his own blow dryer (our second one in case the first one breaks and for travel) and actually plugging it in and letting him handle it while he his blow drying his hair after bathing. Again I had to take matters into my own hands and took that damn thing away from my son as he started pointing it towards his privates and wouldn't you know a second after I took it he peed again. I flipped. I told him he could have the blow dryer but NOT plugged in. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\- our son having an eye infection needing eye drops and bf simply not administering them and waiting for me to do it but I was at work and could only to it later than he was supposed to take them. We had already switched to heavier ones as the first ones did not help the infection and it was crucial to stick to the times administering them. \r\n\r\n\\-our son got stung by a wasp, becuse my bf let him pick up apples from the ground while wasps and bees were swarming around them (this summer was so hot here and the bees and wasps were so crazy this summer). He did not even have his cellphone with him. What if my son had an allergic reaction? They were out in the woods and he had no means of communication. He didn't even tell me when they got home. It was me who realized our sons finger was swollen and he said it hurt. The bf told me \"oh well he came up to me crying and I didn't know what was wrong. I guess that was it then\". \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-our son was allowed to run around with a screwdriver, playing with it unsupervised, while the bf was reparing something in the other room. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI could go on, but I don't want to think about any more about these things. I am at my wits end. People have asked me about how my partner watches our kid. I have been asked why our kid wasn't wearing a jacket when it was cold (I put one on him and his dad took it off). I have been asked how I feel knowing my son runs around by himself while my partner talks to friends. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo of course, over the past 19 months I have developed a fear of leaving my son with my bf or letting him visit his parents with ihm without me there as well. I TRY to get over it, somehow. I know I migiht be on the extreme side, but...it's my baby. There is a time and place for everything, I understand my kid gets older and wants to do big boy stuff. No problem. But at 19 months I don't want him handling knifes, being on his own without someone supervising him and handling other things that are not supposed to be handled by a 19 month old. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI know I am not a perfect parent, while these things have never happened when I was with my son, I know SOMETHING could happen as well while he is in my care. I do let him play on his own and I do go to the bathroom without him by now. I do let him spend time with my bf. But I am uneasy every time. I know I have to let my baby grow up, and this is not about it. It's simply about the safety of my child. \r\n\r\nI get that these things \"happen\" but it's the way they happen. I don't even want to protect him from \"everything\" but I don't want to stand there and have things happen to him because I or anyonbody else didn't watch him properly. I don't want him to be overtired because someone couldn't resist feeding him too much sugar.  He is a bad sleeper as it is anyways.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo. My bf is planning on visiting his parents without me. He keeps telling me to enjoy the day off and have some me time but I can't. He is also planning on going to an indoor waterpark with my son and my niece and nephew. He plans these things when he knows that I have stuff to do. For example bake a cake for a party or sew something (clothes) for friends. \r\n\r\nI appreciate it so much that he wants to take our son and give me the chance for some free time but not like this. So I instead, postpone all the things I would have to do and tell him I will be coming along. \r\n\r\nHe is not willing to change anything about his lack of proper care of our son. He says I am taking things too serious and that everything will be fine. I have tried and tried over and over again to talk to him but he simply cannot see the potential danger he is putting our son into....on a regular basis. But when I think about all the things that have happened and especially could have happened while our son was in his care...I can't. I feel sorry for it but I can't change it. He is my son and I love him more than anything. I have always wanted a boy just like him. He is the light of my life. I just want him taken care of porperly. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo...am I the ass for saying and doing the things I do? \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nYour opinions please. Please bear with me, I do not want to put his dad in a bad light, as he is a loving father, I just want to someones honest outside opinion. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;"}, "352": {"id": "dmbx00", "title": "WIBTA for clapping back at my cousins", "body": "I (19M) am in a group chat with my cousins.

Nights off are usually once a week.\r\n\r\nOn such a weekday night off, the three of us made some loose plans in the ground floor office to head out and eat together; nothing too concrete. We decided to go up, change out of our uniforms, and meet downstairs to decide where to go. Since I stay on a lower floor, I go up, shower, and come down in my civilian faster than the other two (who stay in the same bunk).\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, only one of them (let's call him Norman) comes down.

By this time I'm unhappy because I feel he's treating us like delivery, when our original intention was to eat together. I text Tim that he should come down and at least pick up the food/eat it in the office, since we bought the sandwich for him, but Tim says it makes more sense for him to stay where he is and just have Norman bring up the food for him, since he'll be going up eventually anyway.

I thought that was silly seeing as how many people hide their atheism and I'm not open to my entire family about how I'm an atheist and lack of religion, the fact that she was hiding hers with how Christian dominated our culture is but I've respected her wishes. She also mentioned she got paid a small stipend so I assumed she was just doing it as easy gigs for the money...but later talking to her she admitted to me she not only plays keyboard and sings there but has actually preached a few times...so she's actually doing it because she believes it. Which I also found weird because she's not \"church looking\" at all (has a whole sleeve of tattoos and a full back piece) and is quite progressive, and has gay and even sex worker friends, actually even more than me since I love guns and she hates them and I promised her to never show her the guns I have. She also talks a lot about having sex with her exes (single now.)\r\n\r\nSo I've ribbed her a bit about it, nothing harsh but kind of joked about how she's singing to an invisible man or worshipping a zombie on Easter. I think its ridiculous she's hiding this when it actually way elevates her in most people's opinion over a godless heathen like me and our other roommate. She seems to be getting kind of irritated about that and kind of angrily told me \"none of your business\" when I asked her why she had so much premarital sex with her exes if she actually believes in this even though she's the one at the time who brought up having sex. I still think she's a cool person but I can't wrap my mind over how she's embarrassed about being part of our mainstream culture and think thus it's ok to do some light ribbing (it's not she's in an oppressed minority group), plus I'm respecting her wishes for privacy.\r\n\r\nSo is she being oversensitive or am I being a dick?"}, "360": {"id": "da7k4r", "title": "AITA for criticizing my stepsister\u2019s choices?", "body": "My (22F) stepsister (19F) and I have known each other since we were very young and I consider us fairly close.

I got a job working on a team of eight, including a girl that I'll call Laura. Laura is cute, not really my type, but we have a lot in common including an affinity for our hometown sports team. We spend a lot of time together going to happy hours with coworkers, playing board games, generally being friends- certainly nothing romantic. \r\n\r\nFast forward five months and we start chatting a bit more often, frequently about more and more intimate things. Because we work together, we still deny any feelings starting to develop. The next month, she finds out she's moving overseas. She quits her job, but before she quits, I do some pretty sizable farewell gestures, including planning a going away party. At this point, it's clear we definitely have feelings for one another and, because she's no longer part of our org, we start making out and eventually hook up a couple times. Because she's going overseas for a few years, we have a long discussion that I shouldn't wait for her and that if we start to date other people, it's ok.\r\n\r\nLaura moves overseas to a place where she knows absolutely no one. She helps me apply for her job, which I get. We text NONSTOP. We send each other dirty pics, talk often on the phone, tell each other we love one another. She meets a few local people but still doesn't have all that many people. Meanwhile I'm continuing to make friends in the city I live in, meet new people, generally continue on with my life.\r\n\r\nIn August, about five months from when she left, I met this girl (Nicole) that I fell absolutely head over heels for. Because I was interested in cultivating this new relationship, I started to spend more time with Nicole and less time talking to Laura. I don't want to upset Laura with the development of a new relationship, so I don't tell her about Nicole, especially if it doesn't work out. Laura seems to notice something's off, and asks me about it- I tell her everything is fine. We continue to chat, though at a lighter rate; I read her texts and don't respond right away like I used to. In my mind, it now feels like I'm in two relationships.\r\n\r\nI decide to tell Laura that I'm seeing Nicole to help explain why I'm being so distant. I text her (probably the bad move) and tell her that I'm seeing someone and want to talk to her about it. She says ok, we can talk on the phone after I'm out of work. After I get out of work, I give Laura a call. Laura is furious at me, saying I destroyed her trust, ruined our friendship, that I'm a pussy for not telling her about Nicole sooner. She says she no longer wants to talk to me until I think about the situation and apologize. I say ok and hang up.\r\n\r\nIn about a week, I send Laura a long email apologizing for hiding my relationship from her and being so distant. We talk for a while and she agrees to start talking to me again under one condition: If I start getting distant again, she's going to stop talking to me for good. I say ok and hang up.\r\n\r\nFast forward a few weeks and we're still chatting a bit but this time I notice her getting a bit more distant. Short answers, curt responses, no longer continuing conversations. I figure she no longer wants to talk and stop talking. She doesn't resume conversation. That was the last time I talked to her- she's now blocked me on all social media, blocked my number, and told other friends of ours about the situation, essentially turning those friends against me. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, I understand why she's mad at me- I basically continued a relationship with her after she moved and didn't address the issue when something else came up. On the other hand, she chose to move away, understood I wouldn't wait to be in a relationship with her longterm, and didn't bring it up further when it seemed like I was pulling away. So the real question is- am I an asshole or is this just an unfortunate circumstance in which I lose a good friend of mine?

I enjoy learning about these things but I personally do not believe in it, especially since a lot of the ideologies within these religions often clash with my personal/moral beliefs. \r\n\r\nFast forward to a few months ago when I met my (20m) boyfriend. I messed up from the jump by not being 100% honest with him but I was honestly just scared he wasn\u2019t going to like me anymore. I just know that some Christians are really against non-believers.\r\n\r\n He is religious, he goes to church pretty much every week, he prays before every meal, and goes to church events outside of regular service. I fully respect his beliefs and I honestly think it\u2019s really nice that he has this faith. It helps him in day to day life and I would never ask him to abandon his beliefs for me.\r\n\r\nWhen he first asked me about my feelings about God I just told him that I was not raised very religiously but I\u2019d be open to learning about it. This is all true.\r\n\r\n My sister however thinks I\u2019m lying to him. She thinks I shouldn\u2019t participate in religious things with him if I don\u2019t fully believe in it.

All the remaining people are people I honestly don't care about, even though they're kind and I've known them for a while. However, when they're at a party, there's no way to get in touch with anybody : my little brother will play with his cousins, my step-mother will obviously spend some time with her family and my father will socialize with the guests. My big brother is left but we see each other \"often\" already so there's no way we can entertain one another for five hours straight.\r\n\r\nAll of that is legit, but that makes me just HATE being there. I thoroughly dislike this kind of party - when I move from my home and get to spend time with people, that will be my family and no one else. Weekends are fucking short.

It\u2019s enough to disrupt my nightly routine and honestly it just sucks to hear her crying every single night, it\u2019s a huge downer.\r\n\r\nMorgan seemed embarrassed and got defensive saying that she was sorry it bothered me but it\u2019s none of my business and it was rude of me to ask her.

Christine is about 4 months pregnant, and given that we spent 5 years living together as roommates, we've all been through some serious stuff together and are quite close; it's fair to say that they're some of our best friends.  When they told us they were expecting, we were both naturally ecstatic for them.  And when she mentioned that she would consider being our surrogate afterwards, we felt beyond grateful.\r\n\r\nWe've been there for all the steps on their baby journey, and although I'm really happy for her and wish her the best, I'm not the most baby-lovey person.  I don't go for holding newborns, and I don't sigh and gasp when someone brings out a baby, but my partner does.  He's definitely feeling the ticking of his biological clock, and is enamored with babies in general.  (We've been together for 8 years, and both of us eventually want kids.  I just think the 4-12 range is more fun than 0-3.)  Normally I find it pretty amusing, but tonight was a little different.\r\n\r\nThe entire time we were playing the board game, he was rubbing Christine's bare belly in slow circles.  **2 hours, almost non-stop**.  To the point where he'd place a meeple with one hand while still rubbing with the other.  I didn't say anything at the time because Christine said that it felt \"sooo good\", and her husband, who was also at the table with us, didn't seem to mind either.  But to me it felt a little too intimate, especially for that length of time.  If it was like 15 seconds or less, like a, \"How's the baby!\" kind of thing I'd be fine, but that long made it awkward.\r\n\r\nAfter we got back, I told him that it made me a little uncomfortable.  That it wasn't jealousy, that it probably came from my own family not being especially touchy, but that it struck me as something a husband would do, not a friend.  And that I was fine with him doing it when I wasn't there, but to do it for that long when I'm around felt *weird*.  I also said that if he was doing it in public I would have asked him to stop.\r\n\r\nHe totally disagrees and thinks that my hangups and insecurities aren't his, and that he doesn't see anything wrong with it, but appreciated me letting him know.\r\n\r\nSo, AITA here for asking him not to rub her belly for so long in front of me?"}, "390": {"id": "b7czzf", "title": "AITA for saying to my sister that I was an incel?", "body": "So I (22M), used to be an incel.

I usually attend them from my mom's house, as her place is closer (my parents are divorced) but sometimes I take the bus from my dad's. \r\n\r\nToday I was letting him know about a birthday party that my friend was hosting. He talked about how he got my friends confused sometimes and confirmed which one I was talking about. Then, he asked me which route I took to another friend's house, who I go to more often. I have lived in this area for a long time, but only recently have I been walking from place to place. I always use my phone to navigate to where I need to go. I only pay attention to where I need to take a left or right or cross, but I never look at the streets and I don't remember them afterwards if I do.

When talking about a street called Acacia, he said \"Acacia is a type of tree,\" in the same slow tone. I don't know if he was doing this to make me mad or if he actually thought that was valuable information. This went on for a REALLY long time, until eventually we reached our house and left the car.

Dad was trying to rewind it and accidentally started the movie from the beginning. He asked me to help him and, in a very condescending voice, I said \"We want to press *that* button. Do you know what that button is called? It's a *rewind* button. It makes the video go back.\" \r\n\r\nMy dad got pissed, understandably. We had a fight about it and I haven't apologized.

We travel back to my parents house to see him whenever he is home but as my mum works on Saturdays we always go on a Sunday. \r\n\r\nIssue: my brothers 21st is coming up on Thursday March 26th. We always have a family meal but seeing as it is a big birthday extended members of family will also be coming. I currently dont know if this meal is going to fall on the weekend before or after his actual birthday. My BFs dads birthday falls on Sunday March 22nd. \r\n\r\nYesterday when I got home my boyfriend announces that there is a family meal for his dads birthday (not a special one) on the Sunday 22nd. I replied saying that's fine but I dont know when my brothers 21st meal will fall so essentially I was giving him a heads up that it's possible we might have clashing plans. My boyfriend out right tells me he will not be missing his dads birthday meal to go to my brothers. His answer to clashing plans was 'we go our separate ways'.\r\n\r\nHis answer really upset me but I tried to compromise. The logical suggestion was that we take his dad for lunch and spend the morning and afternoon with him and then we would head over to my brothers celebration in the evening. Nope. This would not work for my BF. \r\n\r\nWe then got into a very heated argument as I feel that he puts his family first.

He has lied to me about serious things like this before, such as when he fibbed about \u201cfamily legal trouble\u201d just so he could mess with another one of his gfs.\r\n\r\nD is grounded a ton by his pretty chill parents, and curses them out regularly (his mom more than his dad). \r\n\r\nS is D\u2019s 4th (maybe 5th) gf since middle school, and all of his previous relationships lasted at least a month (Max 6 months). He cheated on at least 2, from his account. Therefore, he has experience with girls, and the bliss of a new relationship is most likely fake. \r\n\r\nA final point I will make is that he regularly calls S a bitch and cunt on his private snapchat story.\r\n\r\nI hope this extra information is helpful.\r\n\r\nEdit 3: I really don\u2019t think that 2 texts after no response is super needy, but I\u2019ve been needy before, so I wouldn\u2019t put it past myself.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don\u2019t just depend on him.

They are all around 30 years old and as I am the youngest, I have always been left out.

So this is just to say that I am not close to them but they\u2019re still family so they are obviously going to get an invite. Most of them have children and we are going to invite the children as well.\r\n\r\nHowever one of my cousins has two of the worst kids (I think they are 2 and 5) I have ever met. Basically they are never calm. All they do is scream, run and cry. The rare times when I see them is during family dinner and they give me headaches. Whatever they do their parents never say anything to them and let them do whatever they want. For example last time we had dinner with them at my mom\u2019s house they jumped on the sofa, opened the fridge etc and their parents let them do as they want. When my mom kindly asked them to stop they just started screaming and crying. My other cousins\u2019 kids never do this kind of things, they are all really calm and well behaved.\r\n\r\nSo when I mentioned that I didn\u2019t want them at my wedding, my mom said that she understands why but I can\u2019t not invite just them. I said that I would offer to pay for someone to watch them for the day and night of the wedding and even the next day if my cousin wants to stay for the brunch we are planning but my mom insists that I can\u2019t ask my cousin to not bring them with her because when she will realise that the other kids were invited she could get angry and it could cause drama.

Still unnecessary and a waste of money, but perhaps something I shouldn't so vehemently refuse?

People think it\u2019s interesting\u201d.  \r\n\r\nSo that is a little extra context to the situation in my community. \r\n\r\nOriginal post:\r\n\r\nTitle pretty much sums it up. This happened a few years ago and it still bothers me because I really don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but I know I made a very nice young person upset. \r\n\r\nI (47m) teach in a high school that has a significant refugee population. \r\n\r\nOne day I was showing a student (17/18f)  how to use a piece of equipment. We were in a room with other students, but nobody was paying attention to our conversation, so only the student and I heard what I said, so I definitely didn\u2019t embarrass this kid in front of the class. That\u2019s not what happened here at all. \r\n\r\nShe was trying to find a word to ask me something and she mentioned that even though she\u2019d been in America for 5 years she still didn\u2019t know some words. I said \u201cif you don\u2019t mind me asking, where is your family from? She said Nepal and I said \u201cwow, that\u2019s so exotic! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a student from Nepal\u201d. \r\n\r\nShe made a bad face right away. I asked if I said something wrong. She asked what I meant by \u201cexotic\u201d and I said something along the lines of \u201crare, unusual, like people might say a really fast car is exotic, or some rare pets, like a colorful bird, might be called exotic. You are from a far away place that very few people in this area are from so I said exotic. I don\u2019t think thats a negative thing, that\u2019s not how I meant it\u201d. She said ok and I thought that was the end of it. \r\n\r\nSo over the next few days the student just seemed mad at me. A couple of her friends tell me that she\u2019s really upset by what I said. I asked the friends if they thought it was bad of me to say, or if she was overreacting. They said maybe a little of both. They said I made her feel weird by using the word exotic. I felt bad about this. \r\n\r\nSo after a week or so I had the chance to talk to her privately and I told her that I was really sorry that I said something that upset her, but I didn\u2019t realize that word would be upsetting. I just think it\u2019s cool that I get to meet kids from all over the world. She told me it was fine, but I should never tell someone they are exotic. She didn\u2019t elaborate.

I am looking for impartial judgement as to whether or not IWBTA if I ghost my friend after she betrayed my trust. Sorry in advance for the long story!\r\n\r\nI (25F) live in an apartment with my boyfriend (30M). About a month ago, my friend (25F) came into town for a weekend visit and stayed with us. We all ended up hooking up. This was completely random. My boyfriend and I had previously discussed having a threesome with another female, but were NOT expecting it to be with a friend of mine (or anyone that we know, for that matter.) We had been drinking and it just kind of...happened. If anyone was an instigator, it would have been me. Stupidly, none of us ever discussed any \u201crules\u201d prior. The hooking up amongst us three continued throughout the weekend. \r\n\r\nOn the last night, I fell asleep in bed next to my boyfriend and my friend after we had all messed around for a while. In the morning, I sensed that they were both acting \u201coff\u201d and assumed that something was up. While helping her pack up her things, I asked her if everything was okay. She said yes. Then I asked her if anything happened between her and him after I fell asleep. She (very quickly and nonchalantly) said \u201cNo, we just cuddled.\u201d I thought her reaction was odd but figured that maybe she was just stressed or nervous about seeing her family or flying back home, because surely she wouldn\u2019t lie to me. (Spoiler: she did.) \r\n\r\nAfter she left, I asked my boyfriend if anything happened between them after I fell asleep. He told me that they made out and then she sucked his dick. He apologized profusely for assuming that I would be okay with them hooking up without my involvement. \r\nI was VERY upset with both of them. \r\n\r\nReminder: I am not looking for advice on what to do with him. That would be a different story for a different thread.\r\n\r\nLater that day, I texted my friend and again asked her if she and my boyfriend hooked up while I was asleep. She replied saying she \u201ccan\u2019t lie to me again\u201d and then told me the truth (the same story my boyfriend told me.) She apologized profusely. I told her I needed some time to comprehend everything, and would let her know when I was ready to talk.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been about a month and I am still extremely angry and disappointed with her.

She was upset and told me it was okay since they get a special rate on the bridge if they cross it x times per week. I said he should have no problem covering  that rate then. I also told her that their car would need more maintenance travelling that often on a busy highway and they'd need to budget for that, too.\r\n\r\nShe then told me nobody else could do the job and he really needed them since nobody else was responding to the ad he put out for janitors.

Over the Easter holidays, my (f19) parents and little sisters (both 14yo) went on a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" Orlando parks trip. We live in the UK, and the trip was taking a flight from London, changeover in New York then fly to Orlando, where they spent two and a half weeks in an AirBnB style holiday house and visited Universal and Disney World. They did their best to keep the trip cheap while still enjoying it, so the flights were on miles, they limited eating at the parks etc. We did a quick check after the trip and adding me to the trip would have cost roughly \u00a31000.\r\n\r\nHowever, I didn't join them on this trip. This was nothing to do with money at the time, I just absolutely hate that kind of thing. Large crowds give me anxiety, roller coasters do nothing for me, I hate having my days completely planned out and I don't really like leaving \"my space\", i.e. my room in our house. So we talked it out and I stayed home while they were gone. I decided to take a paid vacation from work for that time anyway so I can have a little break myself and ended up spending a lot less than I would have over the same period of time, because I didn't have to commute to work and I kind of forgot to eat most days. There were no hard feelings over this on either side afaik.\r\n\r\nI'm in a full-time paid internship right now to save up for uni next year because I'm only eligible for the minimum maintenance loan which only really covers accommodation. My mum is quite stressed out about the money because my savings would probably not last more than a year with this loan by her estimate (which I think is a little bit extreme but still somewhat accurate). After that, they would be helping me with the remaining money I need because my course is quite intensive and my uni doesn't technically allow students to have jobs.\r\n\r\nNow, it's been a dream of mine for a while now to build a PC. We were planning for me to buy a good laptop for a while now (and relatives even sent me money towards that for my birthday) because mine wasn't working and you really need a laptop in uni. Then I fixed my old laptop for nearly no money, so it is now capable of typing up lecture notes etc. I got the idea that instead of buying a new laptop I can build a PC (which is significantly cheaper) fr around \u00a3850. I brought up the idea to my mum and she snapped. She shouted at me for ages about how I'm irresponsible with money, how I don't need that for my course but I've been too stubborn to stop talking about it, and how she also told me I didn't need a new laptop (which I don't remember but I have memory issues). Now she's right that I don't strictly need this new computer for my course, but WIBTA for pointing out that she was willing to spend \u00a31000 for me to join on a \"dream vacation\" when this is much more of a dream for me? Especially with the \u00a3300 from my relatives as contribution. I'm genuinely looking for your judgments here because I'm not great at telling this stuff.\r\n\r\nEDIT: To clarify, I would be paying for the PC myself with money I earned this year, but the lines between \"my money\" and \"their money\" are blurred because they're going to help me pay for uni, because as far as I can tell I have no other choice for that (there isn't even an extra loan I could take, because I would, I'd be happier building up debt than having my parents pay for my uni)."}, "414": {"id": "d6hc60", "title": "AITA for wanting my SO to talk to me more", "body": "So i (19m) have been dating my (18f) GF for a year and a bit now.

I dont stop her from doing these things as its her life and im not going to tell her what she can and cant do, so i asked her if she could update me and message me through the night (when she does go out drinking).

Im a little upset with her as i wanted to call but we couldnt because she was going to a party, so i tell her how im feeling and of course this starts another argument(i didnt even want a full blown conversation just at least her to fill me in with whats happening). Fourth day she goes to the city centre with friends and ends up leaving me on read and blanking my messages, while she is clearly online and on her phone uploading to IG.\r\nI asked her about it and she said that she didnt notice my messages (knowing that she lies and me with my trust issues i automatically think bullshit). She told me that i knew she was with friends so dont expect to have full conversations and that im being unfair to her and controlling. She says that im trying to change her as a person by getting her to always be messaging me. Today the same thing has happened where ive talked to her and shes blanked the messages saying that they arent popping up.

We figured we could buy the booze and pay one of my cousins to be bartender for the night, and we realized we could probably recoup some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for drinks - win-win! We were set on this idea until I brought it up with one of my bridesmaids and she flipped out and said that would be incredibly tacky.\r\n\r\nI was sort of taken aback by this.

Except for a brief period of falling out in 2016, we've spoken at least 4 times a week. She was close with me and my sister, T (25F). When my sister got pregnant in the beginning of 2018, S would check up on her once a week minimum to make sure she was okay. \r\n\r\nI ended up getting pregnant later on in the year, right before i moved to a different state (we already lived in different states; S is away at college). I didn't tell many people about the pregnancy until the second trimester because i had previously been told i was unable to have kids and was unsure about the viability. I lost quite a few friends because of the pregnancy/move, but my close friends understood my reasons for everything. \r\n\r\nWe had a gap in communication, as we usually did at the beginning of each school year due to her being busy, but S gave me a call when i was about 20 weeks along. I told her about how our close mutual friend, E (22M) has sent me an essay about why he didn't want to be friends with me anymore, citing my move and pregnancy as two main reasons. S didn't seem surprised about E, but was shocked that i was pregnant. I hadn't announced it on social media yet, and only my family and friends who i had recently seen knew about it. Her reactions afterwards were a bit odd, mainly after i told her who the baby's father is, and she said she'd call me back when she got to her apartment. \r\nI didn't hear from her for a year. \r\n\r\nFast forward to about a month ago, i had recently moved back home with my child and fianc\u00e9 and i got a random facetime call... from S. She acted like nothing had happened, and said she was going to be in town the next day and wanted to see me and meet my kid. I was excited about it since i hadn't seen her in so long, but when i told my fianc\u00e9 (22M), who also knows her, he said i shouldn't go. He called S fake and said that she seemed to be up to something, having gone a full year in silence then hitting me up out of nowhere. I didn't see it that way at first, but as the day went on, i started getting uncomfortable about seeing her. The next day when she texted again about hanging out, i didn't answer and we still haven't spoken. \r\n\r\nI spoke to a friend and my mom (who both know S well) and they understood why i didn't go, but my sister T said i should've given her the benefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\nAm i being an over dramatic asshole? I'm very private about my kid and i want him to meet my friends, but i'm skeptical due to the timing of it all (my falling out with E, and S still being in contact with him).\r\n\r\nEDIT: during the year that S ghosted me, i tried to contact her a few times through snapchat and facetime but never got responses. fianc\u00e9/baby daddy saw how upset it made me and suggested i stop trying. since i was pregnant and he didn't want me to be stressed.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: T implied that during the year, she had been in contact with S, but wouldn't offer more than saying she hadn't heard from her in a couple months. i'm aware that the situation seems weird and that it doesn't add up, which is why i'm so torn about it. \r\nalso, no, my fianc\u00e9/baby daddy and S don't have a history aside from us all having one class together for one year in high school. she's gay."}, "430": {"id": "ea81i8", "title": "AITA for sitting on my brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s butt to wake her up?", "body": "My brother\u2019s girlfriend (19F) slept with my brother (19M) in his room last night.

His middle son and his wife are best friends with my sister and brother in law. I haven't seen anyone in the family in probably 5 years, but I've known them since I was in elementary school (went to the same church, were neighbors, same school etc). \r\n\r\nJoe had ALS and was found not breathing by his wife on Friday.

I've decided that there are too many variables and I can't predict how my son will act.

I put up with it because she could be very thoughtful at times - it was a real Jekyll + Hyde situation.\r\n\r\nWe both knew this girl, Jane, who really idolised Dani and wanted to be like her. I didn't know Jane very well but was casually friendly with her. Dani was outwardly dismissive of her and thought she was pathetic for wanting to copy her. \r\n\r\nAt one point she found the nudes of Jane and Jane's bf on an amateur porn site that she also used. She spread those nudes around amongst our college class and to the best of my knowledge Jane never knew that anyone saw them. \r\n\r\nI ended my friendship with Dani about 3 years ago when I found this out, and because I also discovered that she'd been borrowing people's laptops to do work on and then copying and pasting all their Facebook messages and emailing them to herself. Crucially, I did not tell anyone what Dani did with the messages or the nudes. I was worried that she would leak my private messages if she found out that I told people. I admit that this was a selfish thing to do and in hindsight I really wish I'd taken the hit and told people. I don't have any defence beyond I was 20 and a complete coward. All our mutual friends cut ties with Dani for various reasons soon after but none knew about the nudes or messages.\r\n\r\nCut to this year, and I see a photo of Dani on Jane's Facebook. Turns out that after all her friends abandoned her, Dani went and befriended Jane. Jane is clearly really happy that her idol is now her friend and considers them best friends.\r\n\r\nMy dilemma is that I know that Dani is just generally a very toxic person and Jane is very sweet and easily led. Jane also doesn't know that Dani invaded her privacy so horribly. Part of me wants to tell Jane now, but I'm concerned that I might be the asshole because a. I waited 3 years to do it and now I'm not only telling her that her nudes were leaked, but that they were leaked by her best friend, b.

He left the country and escaped to Spain, leaving behind 4 kids and 3 ex-wifes. That part of his life is over now, i know some of you would never get involved with ex-terrorists but I dont judge him too much for that.

In the weeks following, I spent a lot of free time with Carrie supporting her through the breakup, and we grew so close I now consider her one of my best friends.\r\n\r\nIn the past month, George starts getting flirty with me, and I start liking it, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I straight up ask George \"Hey, are you into me?\" He says a tentative yes. I say \"Okay, if this is going to be a thing at all, you know I need to talk to Carrie first.\" We agree to take the week to think about things before making any moves.\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time trying to think about how to tell Carrie. Ultimately, I fuck up royally. I blurt it out at the worst possible time (after drinking and partying w/ friends), and in this alone I know I am definitely the asshole.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also thought I was doing the right thing by being as above board, honest, transparent, etc, as possible. I told her before anything had happened between George and I, and I wanted to let her know early on so she wouldn't be blindsided in the future, and that I was still unsure with where I stood so I thought it'd be better to hear and value her input before I made a decision about dating George instead of going to her after and just telling her \"Hey, I am going to date George.\"\r\n\r\nShe is extremely hurt. I expected her to be upset, but not this upset. She says I should have waited longer, when the breakup would be further in the past, and when I was more sure of what I wanted. She also thinks it was selfish of me to have deliberately put her through this pain when I wasn't even sure of my feelings. She says I lacked any empathy for her. She views me telling her in advanced, before anything happened, as akin to asking for a guilt-free hall pass.\r\n\r\nShe also says she wants me to be happy, and she recognizes that she broke up with George and ultimately wants him to be happy, and if we'd both make each other happy, she doesn't want to be a factor preventing us from that. However, she also said that in the immediate, she can't be my friend, because the very act of telling her I have feelings for her ex makes her feel physically disgusted, and that being around me would be toxic to her mental health.\r\n\r\nI know I can't expect her to be 100% chipper and okay with everything, but I also didn't expect her to cut me out just for bringing it up, especially before anything has happened between me and George. I felt like I had two options - tell her the truth now before anything happens, or don't say anything and hope the feelings went away (would be lying by omission, possibly blindside her in the future if feelings didn't go away and the flirting escalated).

On top of this, all of my other roommates think that he's the victim because he was outspoken about how I was waking him and in turn how this affected his academic life. I wanted to scream and say the reason why he was falling asleep wasn't because I was waking him for 1-5 mins but because he wasn't sleeping and causing me to lose sleep as well.  As if this wasn't bad enough he's already talked to my RA and gotten close to him so even after I talked to my RA it was like talking to a stone wall. My RA actually recommended me to eat outside in the mornings and work to \"show respect and kindness\" to my roommate. I've been sleeping over at my mates house on the days before midterms and finals and it sucks that despite a room supposed to be a 50-50 he makes it a 90-10.

We cleaned more frequently, played with the cat more, got him a massive cat tree, took him to my mom's as a getaway every 2 weeks, and just generally spoiled him IMO. But none of this worked, because this stupid cat shit in the wrong place another 4 times, each time testing my sanity more and more. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend generally likes animals more than I do.

My girlfriend is in tears too, wailing \"Why would he DOO this!!???\" In my rage, I take the cat and stick his face in the poo in a horrible and useless attempt at forcing a mental connection between \"you're shitting here\" and \"we're not happy about it\". My intention was to immediately wash it off, but my girlfriend freaks out and initiates a mini tug of war that amounts to shit being thrown everywhere. \r\n\r\nAfter spending 4 hours cleaning everything, I announce/decide that i cannot fucking have this cat in my life anymore, and that i will be seeking to rehome him ASAP because i'm not mentally equipped to deal with this kind of behavior.

They live upstairs on the last floor and we are two floors underneath them. When I met them in the house, they've always been friendly to me and they're usually not loud. The only issue we've had with them was when we found cigarette roaches all over the shared backyard, which our children play in and since they're very young, are likely to pick up. Back then I went upstairs, explained the situation with the kids and asked them to pick up the roaches and not leave any anymore. They were friendly, apologised, picked them up and it never happened again.\r\n\r\nBut since they moved in it smells like weed in the house almost every evening. Sometimes even early in the day on the weekends. Because the smell appeared when they came, I always suspected it was coming from them. So today when I came home and the scent was really strong (even in the first floor, far away from their flat) I went up to check and sure enough it was coming from their apartment. I live in Germany where this is forbidden everywhere, so I could report it to the police which is what I want to do. When it's about other issues with neighbors, like the cigarette issue, loud music or whatever, I always talk to the neighbour first.

I told him from day 1 that I didn't want to live with his mom and wanted to find a place for us to live on our own. His mom decided that she wanted to downsize, saying that she would sell us her house and that she would definitely be out by August. It's now almost February, meaning 17 months have gone by since she was supposed to be out. She hasn't picked an apartment, packed up any of her things, or really shown any interest of actually moving out. It causes constant tension with my BF and I because I want her to leave so that we can have our own life together. It is something that we argue about almost daily.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I have is that she initially said that she would fix multiple things around the house. The big thing is that the basement floods when it rains. It blows my mind that someone can live in a house for 30 years and not fix a flooding basement. It doesn't flood every time, but nearly every time it rains you have to make sure that the sump is working and make changes so that it actually pumps water out of the basement. Apparently I don't understand french drain/ sump systems? She had someone assess the basement about a year ago who quoted her $10,000 to fix it. When I asked this morning if she was planning on fixing it, my BF said no, that we would have to pay for it if we wanted it fixed.\r\n\r\nI've asked my BF to help me create a contract with her in regard to the house, when she is leaving, how much she is going to pay for, and how much we will pay for the house, but he doesn't seem to think that we need a contract and thinks it is ridiculous to demand a contract because she is his mom. I have also suggested that we find an apartment until she is actually ready to sell the house. When I bring it up, all he says is \"soon\".\r\n\r\nBringing it up makes me feel like an asshole because yes, we are paying less rent than we would somewhere else, but we are still paying rent. If I wanted to live with someone's mom, I could live with mine for free.\r\n\r\nSo AITA for constantly asking when she plans on leaving? AITA  because I want a legal contract with a date that she will be leaving and exactly how much of the house she will be fixing before she sells it to us? AITA for expecting her to follow through on the promises she made?

The text read along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t touch my food! It\u2019s all gone! Blah blah\u201d \r\nI looked at (20F) and said, \u201cthis is getting out of hand, who on earth is helping themselves to everyone\u2019s food??\u201d \r\n\r\nShe giggles and simply says \u201cme\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout taking her completely seriously we finished lunch and left.

I asked her how she was lying all this time and she said it was easy. She continued to explain how she lied by recalling certain events of being asked. She then told us how she was EATING my housemates baby bell cheese in her bed while my housemate yelled about it in the room next door. \r\n\r\nShe then says, \u201cI guess I am a klepto\u201d and \u201cplease don\u2019t tell the boys I do this\u201d (we\u2019re living with our guy friends next year).

Because of this, she still calls me one of her best friends while I\u2019m unknowingly creeped out by her. (She is on the lease for next year, otherwise I would just cut ties) \r\n\r\nalso, in order to better understand her behavior: she sometimes gets weirdly sad for no reason, she doesn\u2019t have home town friends, she has this paranoia that people don\u2019t like her in the friend group and she is pretty insecure. Another thing to add is she talks about her future man/life A LOT even though she has only had one night stands (she\u2019s never had a thing with a boy). Her behavior has always been odd, however, I\u2019ve always looked past it up until now. \r\n\r\nSo what I want to know is, AITA by talking to my friends about this behind her back, even though I haven\u2019t talked to her first?

This is a throwaway because a lot of people from work are on Reddit. \r\n\r\nI [27M] work in a highly competitive industry. I\u2019ve been working the same job for a few different employers over the last nine years, since I dropped out of college after my freshman year. Things went pretty well my first few years on the job. Our branch wasn\u2019t performing as well as we could have, but I was considered a prodigy and I was able to shine in my new surroundings. \r\n\r\nAfter my third year, this guy (let\u2019s call him L), who is considered among the best ever to do this job, decided to return to my branch. It was really fun for the first couple of years. The branch was performing very very well, much better than before L showed up. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed working with L and he helped mentor me and make me even better. \r\n\r\nAfter three years operating in L\u2019s shadow, I decided I wanted to run a branch again. I was sick of his paternalistic tendencies. He would always act like he was my dad and I eventually got sick of it. So I asked for and was granted a transfer to a new branch. \r\n\r\nI was expected to be a leader at my new branch, and I was ready. But two other people I was counting on for the success of myself and the branch were both very young and inexperienced. It was clear to me that management didn\u2019t want to support me by providing me with the talent I needed to succeed, and I said as much offhandedly to a few people, who apparently took offense. They said I was acting \u201cimmature\u201d and like a \u201cbad leader.\u201d The writing was on the wall, and I engineered a transfer to another branch last summer. \r\n\r\nShortly into my tenure with my new branch I sustained an injury on the job and was unable to work for a few weeks. The branch did pretty well when I was away from work, so I expected that I would make it even better upon my return. My first day back on the job was a couple of days ago, and it was awful. We were just incredibly unproductive, and in an industry where every branch is trying to get a leg up on every other branch, that is unacceptable to me. I pointed out to management and to some of my coworkers that I thought we needed to hire some extra people with more advanced skills than the people we have now. And we have to do it soon; there are some serious deadlines approaching for us. \r\n\r\nPeople heard through the grapevine about my latest comments and have been really pissed off. Like, really pissed off. My coworkers have been freezing me out. Management is considering shipping me off again. But in my opinion, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

I (22M) am in a volunteering organization that revolves around digital media. 6 months ago I entered the organization as a simple member of the IT team. All my tasks were done the other departments were happy with me.\r\n\r\nSuddenly 3 months after my entrance the leading manager quit. The position had to be filled so HR chose me not only for my technical skills but for the ambition/vision I had for the whole organization. I really liked the idea and I wanted to make the best thing I could do.\r\n\r\nSo I have all these responsibilities but the lack of support from the team in all the small tasks that had to be done. I understand that this is \"no pay\" but you knew from the beginning that it was for free.\r\n\r\nThe team won't bond at all and there is awkwardness in general. We've spoken many times with the second manager (23M) about this. The thing is that he was going on and on about how much of a friend I am to him and that he wants to be more than partners.\r\n\r\nTo add, my mom got diagnosed again so I have to be every week to the Hospital for Chemo, and I am working while I wait.\r\n\r\nToday was the first meeting of the year, really important. I went 1 hour prior to the meeting while I was there my laptop had 40% battery and I wanted to hold on to that for the meeting. So a member suggested we use the other manager's laptop. It had a PIN, other people where around and we're making jokes about cracking it. One of them was \"Hey maybe try 1998\" and I typed it in and it worked. We had a huge laugh about it plus HACKERMAN memes, and it was great because I felt like we had a nice ice breaker.\r\n\r\nThe laptop unlocked and it had a Chrome window already open. I minimized it and launched a new Incognito so me and one other member could work.

The thing is, I tough we had a good relationship with this guy and I thought he was actually a friend. So I didn't really think of it like that. So after this outburst of his I stormed out of the office telling him that \"There is no need to get mad, the laptop was unlocked for 1min and the he came\".\r\n\r\nI decided I didn't want to deal with this shit. I've had enough with these guys, all the tasks on me, trying to glue a fucking team that doesn't want to and on top of that I have the emotional stress of my mom's cancer. I went back in, the guy was all friendly and shit. I packed my stuff and told them that I wasn't going to attend the meeting and that he should lead it. He tried to stop me but I just left.\r\n\r\nAITA for leaving? AITA for unlocking my \"friends\" laptop without his consent?\r\n\r\nTLDR; I unlocked a manager's laptop that I thought we had a good friendship with, he started screaming about his privacy and I decided I didn't want to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n**So I immediately called the owner of the organization, who was there at the time of the event, told him that this was the least professional thing I've ever done in my entire life and also the biggest fuck up. I apologized to him for my behavior and told him that I wasn't sure if I would make a leader/manager for the team since I've made something this bad and still storm off like a bitch and if they wanted to terminate our collaboration that would be totally acceptable on my part. I apologized again to him. He told me that mistakes are a part of this job and that the fact that I can tell that this was a mistake was all that he wanted.**\r\n\r\n**I also called the manager and apologized for being a total piece of shit.

My girlfriend and I both apologized to each other. I explained I was caught off guard and that\u2019s why my reaction wasn\u2019t immediate. She apologized because she thinks she was taking out her frustrations on me when in reality she was frustrated with our \u201cfriend.\u201d\r\nSpeaking of, the ex friend left some voicemails on my girlfriend\u2019s phone (I blocked her so I didn\u2019t get any) \r\nThe ranged all over the place from crying and begging for forgiveness to racial slurs directed at my girlfriend.... so.

Just in case, I\u2019m a little paranoid since I lived this before. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to thank you guys here on Reddit.

( TL/DR at the bottom)\r\n\r\nRecently a 5 year relationship between me (21M) and my girlfriend ended when she broke up with me a few weeks ago. She borrowed a large sum of money from me during the relationship and, to her credit, has been paying me back week by week. Despite her paying back the money I believe I\u2019m doing the smart thing by not doing anything to piss her of, as we have no written agreement and if she really wanted to could stop paying I could do very little to retrieve my money. As a result of this I took to Reddit to anonymously vent my feelings because I felt frustrated at not being fully able to tell her about it. To be honest it was very cathartic for me and made me feel a little better to have somewhere to put my feelings and get them straight in my head.\r\n\r\nLast week after having saved a post under my account before we broke up without my knowing, she looked at my Reddit account and saw the posts, then confronted me about it. This led to an extremely uncomfortable conversation where we really got into about our relationship before I was really ready to talk about it. For context she knew I posted personal stuff there and so intentionally went to look for my personal posts to confront me about them. When I told her this behaviour was out of line and was a huge intentional invasion of my privacy she said \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again\u201d.\r\n\r\nI feel like I\u2019ve lost the last place to properly vent my private feelings as I don\u2019t trust her to not look at anything I\u2019m posting. So I came up with an idea. To make a fake post with something extreme written in it, nothing nasty or anything that would intentionally hurt her, but something that she would have a strong reaction to and have to confront me about. This would hopefully teach her to stop invading my privacy when she realises the post is fake and her mind bring in to question the real ness of any future posts giving me a bit more freedom to post what I feel.\r\n\r\nFriends have encouraged me to do this but I\u2019m a little conflicted and wanted others opinion before either continuing or scrapping this idea altogether.\r\n\r\n(TL/DR- WIBTA if I made a fake post on Reddit  that would make my ex call me out so I can\u2019t tell her it\u2019s fake and she\u2019s a fool for stalking my reddit?)"}, "464": {"id": "et5woe", "title": "AITA for getting upset with my gf because she wants to take pole dancing lessons?", "body": "My girlfriend (22f) and I (26m) have been together for 2 years. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve both started going to the gym a lot and in the last year or so we\u2019ve gotten into really good shape. The other day she told me that she\u2019s been wanting to take pole dancing classes for a long time like since before she met me. She said that now her body is at a point where she\u2019s confident enough to actually try it out. \r\n\r\nShe explained to me that she knows there\u2019s still a lot of stigma around pole dancing and it being associated with stripping still. She says it\u2019s become a whole other sport of its own with a lot of women doing it as a form of workout class. She wants to work out, it seems fun to her and she wants to feel sexy doing it. \r\n\r\nI understand the logic behind what she is saying, trust me I do. I\u2019m really trying hard to not sound like an asshole here. But the thought of her wearing booty shorts and stripper heels doing sexy dances in front of other people just really makes me uncomfortable. I understand that it has become a really popular form of dance that requires a lot of skill and strength and I recognize that. \r\n\r\nHowever this still doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s what strippers do and I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with her showing herself off that way to other people. I don\u2019t have anything against strippers just please try and understand where I\u2019m coming from. I love my girlfriend and I try to support her in everything she does. But this one just isn\u2019t going to be something I can get behind. \r\n\r\nI expressed all of this to her and she got upset with me saying I was being ridiculous and overreacting.

I'll put my cereal in a container and I typically forget to put the box away. He'll complain about it as soon as I get home. \r\n* He'll point out if I've forgotten to put something away right away, ie: milk with my coffee (I am not going to put it away after every cup of coffee, it's sitting out of the fridge for max. 1hr)\r\n* If I don't do my dishes immediately after I get home from work, he makes a big deal of this.\r\n* I have a parrot who cannot fly, so he'll hang out on the floor and the odd time he poops. If I see it, I'll sterilize it right away and clean it. There are some times I miss a small poop and my SO will lose his mind and tell me how can I be so blind that I didn't clean the poop. (for the record, he wont clean it up)\r\n* Laundry, I don't always fold everything right way, I tend to start everything too late and fall asleep by the time the dryer is finished.

We had her for 18 years (she was 22, and a bichon frise). I think having a dog would be good for my dad, who has been laid off again after years of unstable work. He recently had a series of heart attacks and has been trying to eat better but does not exercise. The dog would help get him out, and improve his mood in general. \r\n\r\nLiving situation: my parents have been divorced for ~15 years. However, after the economy crashed, they moved back in together. My parents and I have lived in a 2-bedroom apartment for 10 years. (My mom and I share a room, my dad has his own room). My boyfriend sleeps on the couch ~4 days a week, because we carpool to college. So, in the apartment it's me (24M), my boyfriend (22M), my mom (56F) and my dad (60M). \r\n\r\nMy mom doesn't want another dog because she doesn't want to get attached and then have to leave the dog when she moves out. (She thinks she will move out when I do -- but none of us can afford to live on our own, so realistically, I don't see this happening for at least 4 years (when I get out of graduate school)). \r\n\r\nMy dad doesn't want another dog because he can't afford it. This is generally true, however, I can pay for the adoption fee and initial needs like bedding and leashes and bowls etc. The major concern is that if/when the dog gets sick, he would have to open a new line of credit and pay it off gradually. (I am open to doing so as well, as is my boyfriend. There are also lots of reduced-cost clinics in the area, the major concern is more about emergencies.) Every time we see a dog when we're out, he says he wishes he could have another dog. \r\n\r\nI've been mulling this over for years, but obviously haven't done anything about it, because I understand and respect my parents' concerns. I've brought it up to my mom, and she has been less and less resistant over the years, but she also agrees that another financial burden would be difficult. However, after my dad's heart attacks, it's clear that he needs some motivator to get out of the apartment. He has too much stress and there's not a lot anyone can do about it. A dog would bring some much needed happiness. \r\n\r\nThrowaway account because no one likes being the asshole (though, this situation is fairly specific so I'm sure if anyone I know sees it they'll know it's me; but they all think I should get the dog anyway). We're talking like a 15lb dog MAX. Small, small dog. Since my dad is currently unemployed he would be home 100% of the time to train it at first, so imo this is a good time to get it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT/UPDATE: Financial situation hasn't changed much from 3 years ago when my dog died. The only change is my father's health. We did this with a dog for years and it was fine. It was a little hard at the end when she was elderly and regularly needed expensive vet care (like dialysis, surgeries, etc) but we cut costs in other parts of life where we could -- put off car maintenance longer than we'd like but still well within safety, etc. I think if we all pitched in we could afford it reasonably -- we did before. In a worst case scenario in which my parents would want to rehome the dog -- the dog would stay with us until we could find it a suitable home. My boyfriend and I would reach out to friends and their friends to see if anyone could take it.

Like-really bad. My Dad was cheating on my Mom and left her for the lady he was\r\ncheating on her with \u2014and it came as a complete shock because he was always such a great Dad to us and it pretty much destroyed my brother, my Mom and I for awhile. I didn\u2019t speak to him for about 2 years; I mean it was just terrible. But after awhile I started having a relationship with him again (especially once he divorced the lady he was cheating on my mom with). We are back now to where we talk a lot and I of course invited him to my wedding. \r\n\r\nWell my brother never quite got to that point. He saw my Dad a few times over the years but never had a very good relationship with him and I understand that. When my parents got divorced, I was 18 years old, in college and living in the dorms, partying it up and not at home much at all, while my brother was 16, and trying to help my mom get through a very painful time. He told me she would cry everyday and he felt so bad about everything and trying to help my Mom and meanwhile I was off in the dorms and obsessing over boys and stuff. So I do understand that my brother has more bad feelings towards my Dad because he was basically around the aftermath more than I was.\r\n\r\nNow, I (41f) am very upset with my (38m) brother because he really just doesn\u2019t want to make any effort to see my Dad. To me, right now it\u2019s more about what my Dad wants (who says that he really does want to see my brother and have as much of a relationship with him as is possible for the short time he probably has left), than what my brother wants. My bro looks at if as-well, my Dad never made much of an effort to see him. I should add\u2014my Dad lives in Texas, I live in southern Oregon (so flights have been a pain in the ASS to get) and my bro lives in the Bay Area. I never EVER tried to push my brother to have any type of relationship with my Dad once I started having a better one with him. But now, I feel like my Dad has changed his life, realized how much he hurt all of us and has apologized, but also like\u2014he really probably does not have much time left. So i am upset at my brother who I am very close to, for not making any effort to try to see my Dad.

Although they hired a professional photographer, they neglected to hire a videographer for the ceremony. While Diana is getting her hair done, she asks me to record the ceremony on my phone. I told her, \"I don't have enough space on my phone\" because I had no idea how long the ceremony would take place. She came up with the solution that I would sit up front and use her phone to record everything. I agreed to this.\r\n\r\nAs the wedding began, I sat at the front row (they didn't have a wedding party as to avoid hurt feelings, which was fine by me). It was there that I realized that Diana never gave me her phone. Shit. At this point, I figured what's done is done. The wedding was never recorded by me. I still have no idea if anyone else recorded the wedding, but I would assume not.\r\n\r\nAfter the reception as we were driving home in separate cars, Diana texts me to ask for the wedding video. I am NOT going to ruin her wedding night by telling her there is no video, so I told her the file was too big to send.

This is the first time she's brought it up since her wedding. I told her I never recorded it because she never gave me her phone. Then I reminded her of the conversation we had while she was getting her hair done. She was quiet for a moment then said that she had to go.\r\n\r\nMy side: Things were so hectic because of last minute wedding things that I literally forgot about recording it until it was too late to do anything about it. I don't think IATA for not recording it since Diana never gave me her phone, so there was no option for me to do so. Considering the wedding was back in October, I don't remember how much space I had, but I know it was less than 6 minutes of recording time. This ended up being right under half of the ceremony time. I genuinely feel bad about not getting the ceremony recorded.\r\n\r\nDiana's side (I'm assuming; she hasn't called me an Asshole yet, but based off of past experience this can blow up pretty huge): I said I would record it, and I didn't. I should have gotten the phone from her to record it because I agreed to do so.

My relationship with them is complicated to say the least.. \r\nI love them, deeply though. \r\nBUT where the AITA part comes in, I am super close to my brother. He's my mini me.

However, my sister... is such a great kid, but we just don't have much of a bond. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE them equally,  and I would honestly die for either of them.

Parents are getting older and just don't do these things, so I make sure the kids get to do more than sit in front of screens. But I still definitely spend significantly more time with him than her. Even just this weekend she got upset because I was going grocery shopping for our mom, and the bro asked to go, but when she asked I said no. I mean he did ask first, and generally taking them both shopping is the literal worst. But it still really hurt her feelings. I genuinely feel bad and never want to hurt her, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  I should also add that shes a nightmare in public. Even at 12 she will just disappear and wont answer her phone, and when she stays with you she will ask for everything under the sun and throw a tantrum when she doesn't get it. Every time I do something with just her I swear I'll never do it again.\r\nIn her defense (kinda) she's always been her daddy's princess. She wouldn't know consequences or discipline if they punched her in the face.

I could have worded that better. Her and my brother share a father. Obviously thats not it. Granted, he treats my brother more like he treats me, though not to the same extent. I mean to say that his doting on her and never ever ever holding her accountable has made her often mean, aggressive, manipulative and entitled. She is very difficult to be around. I'm not the only.one who feels that way either. Most of mine and my mom's adult friends avoid her because of this as well. BUT I am not so naive to acknowledge that there are factors beyond her control that may influence or reinforce existing feelings, such as the loss of my father.

I work as a shift manager whilst my SO works as a cleaner for a small business. Since she works as a cleaner, I mainly assumed that SHE would do most, if not all of the cleaning.

The first time it happened, my clothes were left on the floor, unwashed and not ironed. I was pissed, but I put them on and went to work (th whole time I felt self conscious and embarrassed).

My wife (25F) was next to me, but I thought it was best to be truthful and said that was a close second best day of my life. They both asked me at the same time what the best day of my life was then. I told them that it was May 21, 2013. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI told them the story. I was always a shy virgin kid who had hopes of becoming an actor. By that time, I had been wanting to audition for over two years but never had the courage to. My roommate gave me a shot of vodka and off I went. I took the train to LA and strutted right into the building. I met this beautiful lady in the elevator and she was auditioning too. We helped calm each other down to put our best chops forward. I never felt that comfortable with a woman before. I felt that if I didn\u2019t ask her out after the audition, I would never get this perfect chance to get my first girlfriend again. It took all my courage to ask her out. I was pretty sure I had her at hello, but it still wasn\u2019t easy to do something I have never done before. We had a nice Korean barbecue dinner together and dated for a few months. We both didn\u2019t pass the audition and pursued the safe path. We had to break up because she had to move overseas with her family, but I was a different man after doing something I have always wanted to do in auditioning and also for meeting her. It was a day of many firsts of my life. I became confident in both my career and personal life because of that. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife said she was kind of sad that the best day of my life had to do with my ex-girlfriend and not her. I said that if I hadn\u2019t met my first girlfriend, I probably wouldn\u2019t have met my wife, and everything happens for a reason. I might have been a virgin all my life if I hadn\u2019t shot my shot and she said yes. I said she opened the door for me to many possibilities, and my wife was the best woman I have ever known, and that we have been together for almost five years and hopefully forever. My wife said that since the best day of my life isn\u2019t the day we met or our wedding day, hopefully the best day of my life would be when our first child will be born in March. I told her that this is getting silly and that will probably be one of the top five days of my life. My wife and sister talked about other things afterwards. My wife seemed kind of down from then on.

However, I know that she never really forgave my now husband and seems to try anything to drive a wedge between us. She was recently cheated on by her long term boyfriend and he left her. She thought they were going to get married. She is child free. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's made a lot of comments recently about my husband and my life choices.

It's always a very family-orientated day, which I like. \r\n\r\nBrother has been with his girlfriend for 2 and a half years. We have seen him maybe twice on his own since they got together (the two Christmases probably, lol). He moved into her house immediately and has lived there ever since. He has lost all of his friends by ditching them to spend time with her... they are literally joined at the hip. Now we all like the girlfriend, but we miss our brother/ son and spending time with him. I used to be so close to him, but now we barely speak. \r\n\r\nNow he's announced that they are spending Christmas together, and without asking, has announced that she will be joining us Christmas morning, during present opening time with my siblings, me and my mum. \r\n\r\nI'm really upset by this. I honestly cherish that family time so much, particularly as I never see my brother on his own anymore. A single hour or two on Christmas morning is surely not too long to spend apart from eachother? \r\nMy mum doesn't care, she welcomes the girlfriend to join us, but I just feel like Christmas morning is ruined for me now. \r\n\r\nAITA because I don't want her to come?\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit to add: For those who think I'm alone and haven't found my own independence yet - I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, living together for 2!

Maya is one person who doesn't fit in to this. They are queer, but they are incredibly wealthy. They are on the older end of the spectrum as well, and have a job at the center helping out other youth.\r\n\r\nRecently, we have been having events that have included raffles. The raffle has included bags with shirts, gift cards, and bus passes. This is where the problem comes in.\r\n\r\nMaya has won these raffles twice, which rubs me slightly the wrong way. They are very well off with parents who will pay for anything they want. This has been apparent especially when their boyfriend has vented his frustration that Maya is willfully ignorant about what it's like to be poor.\r\n\r\nI want to bring it up with Maya and Ben that maybe Maya should either a. Not accept raffle winnings at the center because they are made up of necessities that they do not need, or b. Redistribute the winnings to people in need (For example, their boyfriend would be one of those people) however I genuinely don't know if IWBTA or not.

Sometimes we go out to eat at a nice diner/restaurant in the nearby city, but other than that we normally just sit in bed and watch TV/movies.

I\u2019ve tried to suggest we do something in the house when we spend time together like play a game, cook, etc. Anything really that will keep him awake, but he refuses often stating he would rather watch a movie or something.
