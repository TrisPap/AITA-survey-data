I agreed to buy a calculator from someone who used to go to the same college as me and we were supposed to meet today. However, before I was supposed to meet him, one of my friends who I was with happened to have the exact same calculator and decided to let me use hers for the duration of my college course as she would only need it again next year.\r\n\r\n After this happened, I didn't need to buy a calculator anymore so 1 hour before we were supposed to meet I messaged him that I had to cancel. I understand that this was very short notice and I felt bad for the seller so I apologized profusely. He didn't take it well and proceeded to send me a lot of messages some of which said \"you fucking confirmed with me, I didn't ask you to pay a deposit because I thought you were nice. You can take the calculator and sell it to your friends but you are not flaking on me 1 hour before we meet. I even lowered the price for you and got it by express shipping so you can get it by this week\". \r\n\r\nAt this point I started freaking out because I had never been in this situation before and I'm not a big fan of confrontation, so I apologized again and said  \"You have every right to be angry, I'm not doing this to you on purpose, I'm not doing this to you for fun, but I really cannot buy the calculator\".

On one of the first days there, I met a local guy (25M) and we started dating. Let\u2019s call him Eric. Eric and I dated all semester and it was awesome. We continued the relationship when I returned to America for another year and a half. Honestly, long distance wasn\u2019t too bad and we were really great together. We visited each other a lot and I spent thousands of dollars in airfare and lodging, not to mention the money I spent he visited me too. I had plans to go to grad school in his country and and had even put down a multiple thousand dollar deposit. \r\n\r\nA month before graduation, I feel into a spell of depression and really wasn\u2019t myself. During this time, Eric was extremely unsupportive and told me that \u201cdepression isn\u2019t real.\u201d He eventually broke up with me because he didn\u2019t want to deal with it. It was the hardest thing I ever had to go through and I ended up staying in America. I got a job and built a really good life for myself. \r\n\r\nAbout 6 months after the breakup, I received my first message from him since he decided to end things. \r\n\r\nAnd he had news............he won the fucking lottery (multiple millions of dollars.) I told him I wasn\u2019t sure why he was telling me and pretty much told him to fuck off. It definitely sucked hearing he had such good fortune and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with me.

I lost my cool and told him to leave me alone. When he asked why I pretty told him that I wasted so much time and money on our relationship and he decided to dump me. Being on any sort of terms wasn\u2019t really an option in my eyes. He had fucked up majorly and smashed my heart, and offset my future.  Oh and he\u2019s still in love with me. *eye roll*\r\n\r\nHis response to this was to offer me $5,000 , with \u201cno strings attached.\u201d I initially and immediately told him that I couldn\u2019t take money from him and that there would definitely be strings.

She is not really into the superhero genre like I am, but I dragged her to see Homecoming when it came out and she really liked it. When Far From Home was announced she said she wanted to see it also.\r\n\r\nEnter this week, the movie has recently come out and we are looking for a time for us to see it. It is also the week of her father's birthday and, to celebrate, her mom planned a 3 day trip to a nearby major city. Her dad also wanted to see the movie so the four of us made plans to see it together while we were in the city. \r\n\r\nThe day we are meant to leave, they leave early and I have a short shift at work getting out right after lunch. I did not want to worry about driving downtown and having to park, so I had asked one of my best friends to drive me to the nearby train station and then I would take the train to the city. When he picks me up he says he doesnt mind driving me right to the hotel in the middle of downtown. I ask him if he's sure, thank him, and offer to pay for his gas. He declines, but I grab some snacks for us as he fills up the tank anyway.  Skipping ahead, we make it to the hotel and I give him some cash anyway, whether he wanted it or not. \r\n\r\nHe asks if we can hangout the day I get back from our trip, and I ask if he had anything in mind for us to do. We have a drive in movie theatre near our hometown and he says he wants to go there and see a double feature of Spider-Man and another film. At this point, thinking I would have already seen Spider-Man with my fiancee, agree as I dont mind seeing movies twice. \r\n\r\nLong story short, plans changed and we didn't see the movie while we were in the city. It was her dad's birthday and ultimately his decision on what we ended up doing. So now we are back at home, and I told my fiancee that I was going out with my friend and she gets extremely angry with me. She claims it was supposed to be a movie for us to see together and that I shouldnt be going without her. I call my friend and let him know the situation and he sounds disappointed and slightly angry, as he had been preparing to go for over a day now. \r\n\r\nI tell my fiancee that I'm not going to blow him off after he did me a huge favor by driving me all the way into the city, she disagrees and thinks its weird for two guys to go to the drive in movies anyway.

Well that continued and then the same day she actually decided to do the laundry but ended forgetting it downstairs and blamed me for not reminding her, I had apparently agreed to keep track but I did not hear this request as I had my head phones at that time.

Throwaway with some details changed because my friends use reddit and they would recognize me. \r\n\r\nSome background: my boyfriend (M30) and I (F25) have been together for 3 years. I'm in medical school and my boyfriend is in finance, so we both have pretty crazy schedules. Also, things have been tough lately since I'm studying for my boards. For anyone who doesn't know, the boards the most difficult thing you do in med school, and your score essentially decides your future and what residency you can get into. I'm under the most pressure of my entire life, so I've been in a bit of a panic the last few weeks. \r\n\r\nNow for the story: My favorite band is playing in San Francisco in August, and I really want to go see them. I knew my boyfriend wouldn't really want to go on this trip for a couple of reasons: he doesn't like to go places he's already been, and we already took a trip to see this band at my request. I didn't think this would be an issue since we frequently go on weekend trips without each other. Our schedules and interests don't always align, and I don't have any issues with us taking separate weekend trips. However, we always have planned our big vacations together. \r\n\r\nLast weekend, I brought up the concert to him like this: \"Hey, I want to go see XX band because you know I love them. My friends and I talked about going for the weekend. I would love if you came with us, but I understand if that isn't something you want to do.\" His reaction was furious, he went off on me for being selfish and not \"making joint decisions.\u201d He never told me whether he wanted to come, and I couldn't get a straight answer out as to why he was upset with me about this particular trip. This went on for a few days. Since I've been super stressed due to the pressure I've been under, I asked him to drop it for now. I haven't seen him since the fight, and I've barely heard from him this week (which is unusual, we usually text constantly and stay over each others' places every night). \r\n\r\nThis morning I called him because I was upset about my studying and was thinking I might have to change my schedule around to have more time to prepare. I mentioned this to him and he got very defensive with me. When I asked why, he said \"I'm planning a trip to Costa Rica this summer.\" This came out of nowhere and I asked when he decided this. His response was \"Since you don't take me into consideration for your plans, why should I take you into consideration for mine?\" I got really upset with him and ended up hanging up the phone. \r\n\r\nI feel like these two things are nowhere near the same. To me, taking weekend trips with our friends is one thing but it's another to use his only vacation time to plan a trip without even discussing it with me. Furthermore, I feel like he's only doing it to be petty and make a point. I shouldn't have hung up on him, but I'm so stressed out and it's frustrating to me that he can't let things go when I really need support.

While we were there apparently my brother and my cousin (M30) had talked about my mental disorders, the biggest which is social anxiety.\r\n\r\n After they had talked about it, my cousin kept mocking me for being depressed and not enjoying the trip, for example saying that \"I was gonna have a panic at the airport and get searched by the police\". This got to the point where my uncle had to tell my cousin to stop and all-in-all, it ruined my trip.\r\n\r\n\r\nFast forward a month, after we got back I had stopped talking to cousin on Playstation parties and stuff and didn't want to be around him. So one night my brother wants to talk to my cousin on my PS4, and I say no, which he responds to threatening taking away my PS4 account given we share games. I just tell him fuck off and slept on the couch that night since we share a room too. \r\n\r\nNext morning he says we're going to my cousins and I say no. We get into a heated argument and my mom gets caught up and eventually she says to go to my cousins or go outside, which I took as \"Go or Get Out\". I then stormed out the house and went walked for probably an hour while my brother drive his car with me trying to convince me that I need come back home, and that my mom was crying and that she was gonna call the police to find me if I didn't. I did come back where my mom told me to stay outside while she got my stuff and had my dad pick me up and stay at his house.\r\n\r\nI probably stayed there for a week until my brother came to father's and we had a talk about what happened and came to the conclusion that ESH and that everyone overreacted. He said from his and my mom's side was that I was being a bratty teenager and didn't want to listen. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow fast forward a couple months later and I still haven't talked to cousin. Me, my friends, and brother were hanging out when my brother asked why I still haven't spoken to him, which I said that I don't like hanging around with him because he makes me feel bad, he's rude and kind of an asshole. My brother responded saying that my cousin is very depressed and didn't actually mean what he said, which I responded with, I don't care that's no excuse to be an asshole. My brother then said that I should tell my cousin my feelings and give him some closure and I thought that was a good idea.\r\n\r\nHowever a couple I overheard my cousin and brother talking, and heard my brother tell my cousin everything, which my cousin responded with calling me a pussy and an asshole.

He doesn't really do anything 'egregious' (i.e bring strangers over to do drugs or throw parties when my parents out of town) but all these little things add up and make him (IMO) a horrible person to live with.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, when for the 100th time, my brother peed all over the toilet seat and didn't clean it up, I sent a picture to my mom and said 'Seriously Ian????'

Also, I had literally walked in the bathroom JUST AFTER him. \r\n\r\nShe and I talked about it because I was so pissed off but she said we had to just let it go because of how angry he gets when you call him out for things he's done wrong/bad. He can't 'handle criticism.' I just said fine.\r\n\r\nWell except yesterday it happened again. I walked in just after him and it was all over the seat and ground and was disgusting. I knocked hard on his bedroom door and said 'Hey are you gonna clean up the toilet seat?

I picked them up a couple hours later and they showed me what they got, and then jokingly/casually told me they stole them.

It's wrong, but money has been tight for me too paying for groceries and half the bills in our house, my parents aren't terribly sensitive of the fact that I don't have an unlimited grocery budget. It made me feel a bit better saving some money but I didn't feel good about it overall, haven't done it since. I feel that they aren't the same thing but I realize both are stealing and I'm being a huge hypocrite (even moreso for working retail myself) for lecturing them about what they did. \r\n\r\nI usually help my sister with buying stuff online, as she doesn't have enough money for a bank account or anything.

We all hang out together (whenever we manage) and we all have fun together.\r\n\r\nSome time ago our friend in the group invited us to a house party at her place. She said it was a \"dark/leather-themed\" party so we needed to dress accordingly. Neither me or my girlfriend had any leather clothing so we had to go shopping. She suggested we go separately and just find out what we got at the party, it sounded fun so I agreed. At that time I had been hitting the gym for a little short of a year, I started showing some results and I was happy about my body (I was starting to show some noticeable muscles, so to speak). Anyways, I went shopping and I bought some cheap leather pants (I mean, I didn't think I was gonna wear them in any other occasion) and a dark sleeveless jacket to go with it. I had a black t-shirt to put under the jacket at home, so I figured I was done.\r\n\r\nSo, the night of the party comes, it was summer, it was pretty hot and my clothes really seemed heavy on me, so I decided to change the black shirt for a white undershirt to put under the jacket. I get a message from my gf that she was going out and I followed suit. I get outside of my friend's place and I see her wearing a nice dark dress and some leather boots. I told her she looked very nice, but upon seeing me her reaction wasn't as good as mine. She asked me if I thought what I was wearing was appropriate, and I said that it was, since it was a dark/leather themed party and I had leather clothings on me. She said that that's not what she meant and she stormed in. I didn't know what to make of it, so I just got in as well and started greeting all my friends. Right away I noticed that everyone was wearing something made out of leather and/or something dark, so I got even more confused about my gf's reaction. But then everyone started pointing out and complimenting my abs pressed upon my undershirt. The boys were teasing me about \"all the pussy I could get\", and some girls were just plain feeling my chest and abs. I didn't think the touching was appropriate, so I just laughed and stepped back so not to make it too awkward. \r\n\r\nI realized at that moment that the undershirt might have been the reason for my girlfriend to be upset. So I went to her and got her aside to apologize for the undershirt and to explain to her that I wasn't trying to pull any stunt but it was simply because it was summer and the leather was already making me hot so I needed something lighter under the jacket. She snarkly replied with \"well, if you think it's appropriate then it's not a problem\". I apologized again for making her feel this way and asked her if she wanted me to go home and change, she then called me an inconsiderate asshole for going to this party \"basically topless\" and that I should go for her friends instead of keep making her uncomfortable. She got out of the party, I tried reasoning with her but she wasn't gonna talk to me and went straight home. I apologized to everyone and went home as well (it didn't seem right at that point to just stay).\r\n\r\nIn my defense, I could have just chosen the black shirt and just suffered the heat for a couple of hours, but I didn't expect that that was gonna be her reaction.

I spend ~3 nights/week at his place, and we\u2019re planning for me to officially move in in the next 6 months. The crux of the problem is, he lives in an apartment that his parents bought for him and his younger brother. His brother, Sam, doesn\u2019t live in the same city anymore, so Josh pays his parents slightly below-market rent for the entire place. Since deciding that I should move in, we\u2019ve been trying to get Sam to pick up his stuff from back when they lived together.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, even though Josh pays rent for the apartment, his parents still see it as \u201ctheir place,\u201d and his mom in particular will come unannounced and stay for long periods. Most recently, she came to the US for 7 months, alternating between staying with Josh or Sam. There was no end date set when she arrived, and she only left because of immigration requirements. She doesn\u2019t approve of me living with Josh, is cold and snarky to me, and is also quite picky about her living environment, so I stay over less when she visits. She also expects Josh to spend every free moment with her, so we rarely get alone time when she\u2019s here.\r\n\r\nAs she was leaving at the end of the 7 months, she mentioned she was planning on being back right after New Years! I don\u2019t think I did a great job of containing my shock, and honestly the knowledge that she\u2019d be back so soon was my breaking point. That night, Josh and I had a long discussion about setting boundaries with his mother. I told Josh that her behavior is making me reconsider our relationship, especially as our relationship gets more serious (I shudder to imagine what she\u2019d be like with future kids).\r\n\r\nSo Josh talked to his mom, and the phone call was apparently a shit show. The highlights are:\r\n- Josh told his mom that, for future visits, she needs to give us set dates in advance. No more unannounced, indefinite stays. His mom responded that it\u2019s her place and she can stay there when she likes. Josh then said that, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll find a new place to move into together. His mom was also offended by this suggestion.\r\n- His mom was angry that we asked Sam to pick up his stuff. In her opinion, they bought the apartment for Josh and Sam, so Sam has a rightful claim over part of it, and we can\u2019t ask him to move his stuff or get rid of it if he refuses.\r\n- She also expressed concern that, if Josh and I eventually marry, I\u2019ll treat her poorly. She was offended at my reaction when she told us when she\u2019d be back, and called me manipulative for saying I was reconsidering our relationship because of her.\r\n\r\nI was having dinner with my college roommate and her family, who are from the same country as my boyfriend, and they think my boyfriend\u2019s mom is not the asshole.

So, earlier this year, I had my own birthday party, in sort of the same spirit. I gave my friends 2-weeks notice and organized it on a long weekend (not an actual holiday, but a time when we had a day off school, so they wouldn't have to worry about skipping the party to do homework/projects). They all RSVPed and said they were coming. Flash forward two weeks, and about 1/3 of them cancelled on the day of. Although I was bummed out, I didn't really see much point in being upset: I didn't want to ruin my mood. Cut to the actual party: so about 5 people showed up, and of them, only 2 of them brought me presents (they also showed up about an hour late so they could buy the presents). Now, I know that birthdays aren't supposed to be about presents, and material possessions aren't everything but 1) I'm a teenage girl - I like stuff 2) those who showed up w/out presents said it was because they didn't know what to get me (despite knowing me for 4 years) and 3) the whole party was generally pretty bad. I tried my best to keep my guest comfortable by planning games(y'all I really BOUGHT a jackbox party pack just for this), serving food and snacks and organizing fun activities (we decorated cupcakes!) but people were generally not that interested. One of my best friends even kept laughing at my dog, saying she was weirdly shaped, and constantly insulting her general body.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow that the year's progressing,  all my friends are having their own parties. I'm super hyped to go to them and have a good time, but every time the issue of presents comes up, I get a little bit pissed. All the other guests get together and plan a group present, expecting me to make contributions of 25-35 dollars. While the money is something I can get over (my parents won't usually let me spend more than $20, but I have been willing to dip into the money I set aside from my summer job to help pay for the presents) what really bugs me is that I feel like my friends don't care about me. All these people planning group presents are my friends too, but they didn't do this for me when it came to my party. It feels like they don't care about me to the extent that they care about each other, and I really feel truly left out. It's really upsetting, especially after they've known me for 4 years.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about confronting them about this, but I don't want to make things awkward between my friends.

I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do.

WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? \r\n\r\nETA: Just a clarification. I do not *want* to out this man. Some people seem to think that this is about me having some burning desire to reveal his sexuality to the world, and that is absolutely not the case. The absolute last thing I want to do is hurt him or his family in any way, and if anything I'm frantically searching for a way to let his wife know he's being unfaithful (which she has a right to know) without outing him. I agree with many of you that I should convince that he needs to tell her he cheated or somehow otherwise end things with her if he truly doesn't want to be with her any more and I plan to discuss this with him at the next available opportunity.

I ask her to get dressed so we can go or I was going to leave her but she decides to hang out in bed a little longer before getting dressed. She puts her hair up and I go use the restroom and come back with key in hand to find her opening her makeup bag (she said she wouldn\u2019t do her makeup as it takes forever in order for me to agree to waiting for her to shower) to put her face on.

My dad has not really been there for us in any shape or form, so I've always been grateful for the love my mom gives and the sacrifices she makes to keep our family happy and together. So, I was entirely supportive that she does whatever she can to make herself happy, she truly deserves it for being such a wonderful woman. \r\n\r\nEnter her boyfriend about two years ago. Initially I was rather nonchalant about the whole relationship, after all as I said, if she had finally found someone who could make her happy, then who was I to complain? I was happy she'd found someone special, but recently I've made an effort to get to know her boyfriend because I didn't want my mom to be sad. And to be very honest.... I just can't fucking stand the guy.\r\n\r\nIt's not like he's just annoying (though he is) or rude (which he is). He's constantly making ignorant remarks about a variety of things that include race and sexuality. To provide more specific examples, he constantly refers to Chinese people as \"orientals\" and makes jokes at their expense (they can't drive, they eat cats, etc). When I was over at his and my mom's place, I was unbraiding my hair (I'm black). He (white btw) started feeling my hair and saying how weird it felt. I was visibly uncomfortable, but I've never been very good at confrontation so I didn't say anything. When my mom noticed and told him to stop, he laughed and kept going. He refers to gay people as \"fags\" and is one of those people who thinks if the LGBTQ people can have a Pride Parade, then so can straight people.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my mom has a drinking problem and she has for quite some time. My family has supported her and recommended that she seek help, but her boyfriend is just very...confusing about it all?

However, then he'll turn around and bring HARD liquor into the house and drink it around her and invite her to drink, it's just fucking confusing and very counterproductive. \r\n\r\nShe frequently invites me to their house and I usually oblige since I want to make her happy and she's done so much for our family, but I just don't want to be around this dude anymore. It's not my place to tell my mom who she can and can't be with, but at the same time I don't feel like me pretending to like this guy (since when around him I just get quiet and it's clear I don't like him) is much help either since it still upsets her.

This isn't an issue, and our only rule regarding it is to drink the coffees out back, not in the front of the cafe and never in front of costumers. However, he always keeps his drink next to the tills. Myself or the manager will leave it on the table in the back, but he will go and bring it back to the front after a few minutes. He knows the rules, we often remind him, but he does it regardless.\r\n\r\nToday, as we were both serving customers, I kept seeing him take sips of his coffee whilst serving the customers, which is a huge no no. I asked him quietly not to do it, but he continued to. Eventually, I took his coffee and poured it down the sink. I thought it wouldn't matter too much as it was free, he can get another, and he has been warned multiple times by myself and the managers. \r\n\r\nWhen we quietened down, he went out back, then came back asking where his coffee was. I told him I poured it away as he was continuously drinking it whilst serving and he could make himself another as long as it was kept out back, otherwise I'd throw it away as well. He wasn't happy, calling me an asshole, that it wasn't a big deal. He went to the manager on shift but she said it was something to sort out ourselves, as she thinks throwing away the drink was too harsh but the kid had been warned multiple times.\r\n\r\nAnyway, he soon made himself another and kept it out back, but has given me the stink eye for the rest of the shift.

I (38M) was very fortunate to have grown up in a rather wealthy home, my parents gave me every opportunity to be successful but also at the same time made me work for what I had. I was never directly given anything just b/c I wanted it. For example, they bought me my first car but had to keep my grades up, do house chores, etc. They also paid for my college but again had to keep my grades up or else I was paying the tuition myself. Fast forward to today I am myself a rather successful professional who works as a healthcare consultant and makes enough money to support my family (2 children), I own several properties around the globe and have built up a significant financial portfolio. None of which was provided or funded by my parents. \r\n\r\nMy wife's side is completely different. My wife grew up in a modest home but her parents supported her as best as they could. They were very loose with their money (when they were able to make it), were \"free thinkers\" / hippies and were / are never good at saving money. I'm not saying they are bad people, they are very family oriented and would give the shirt off their back to anyone. My wife was not as fortunate I was and had to pay her way for everything including college (after we married I paid off the rest of her college loan). \r\n\r\nEven with these differences my wife and I are very happy, I am over the moon in love with her and our family is generally very happy i.e we don't have any marital problems and are very active with our children.\r\n\r\nMy mother in-laws mother (wife's grandmother) recently past away (about a year ago) and left her estate split between my MIL and her two siblings. She ended up walking away with a little over $90k. At the time I mentioned to my MIL that it would be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor so that she could start a retirement fund. That was the last I spoke to her about it b/c my wife has told me in the past to try and not to discuss finances with her because it makes her uncomfortable as she is aware of my success. \r\n\r\nBut to make an already long story shorter I come to find out a few weeks ago that the majority of the funds she received are gone and MIL has spoken to my wife about needing some major repairs on her car, house and other miscellaneous items. My wife discussed it with me and I am having a real hard time with just handing over the money even though I could. My parents brought me up to appreciate the things I have, have worked very hard for my savings / life style and appreciate the value of a dollar whereas it is fairly obvious my MIL does not. I feel like just having over the money would be opening the \"floodgates\".\r\n\r\nAITA for not wanting to help?\r\n\r\nEdit #1: lots of people have been asking what she did with $90k in one year. From what I have been told, a lot of it was given to my wife's brother and to MIL husband's family (wife's parents are divorced). IMO the individuals receiving a portion of the MIL inheritance are just as bad with money as she is. The MIL husband's family didn't even know my MIL mother either, which I found odd. MIL is a few years away from retirement eligibility so I'm not sure why she didn't plan more thoroughly. I get that she seemed to spread the wealth as some people have pointed out, but IMO this money could have really helped her in her later years when she isn't making a paycheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, "585": {"id": "cgii4w", "title": "AITA for apparently ghosting a girl my relatives were trying to set me up with?", "body": "I (25 M) have not been in a relationship and so some relatives tried to set me up with a family friend. She lives in the same state, but about 8 hours away. \r\n\r\nWe started talking via text and things were going okay, but overall felt pretty dry. I wouldn\u2019t say that she seemed uninterested, just that the small talk wasn\u2019t really my thing and I was getting the vibe that we wouldn\u2019t be super compatible. I had heard she was a little shy, and I was the one initiating most of the conversations. Once I initiated she\u2019d be very responsive and seemed interested, until eventually the conversation would flame out and then I\u2019d pick it up again a few days later.\r\n\r\nAt some point I had mentioned that I might be visiting her city in the coming weeks and if she\u2019d be free to hang out and get dinner.\r\n\r\nShe said that she was super busy with school that month and couldn\u2019t promise if she\u2019d have any time to meet up. I responded along the lines of \u201cNo worries, hang in there with the school stuff, you\u2019re a trooper!\u201d to which she followed up with \u201cThanks, sorry it\u2019s just be so hard to get a free weekend the way school is going\u201d. That\u2019s how the conversation ended that night, and I never re-initiated the conversation. It\u2019s now been a few months and we haven\u2019t talked.\r\n\r\nNow I felt she likely had genuine reasons to not want to meet up and may have been legitimately busy. But if she was super interested, she could have made something work. Even if just for a quick coffee.\r\n\r\nSo overall, I chose to interpret that as a lack of interest and decided I would not re-initiate the conversation (but would be receptive if she chose to strike up the conversation again)\r\n\r\nAlthough, emphasis on the \u201cCHOSE to interpret\u201d. I\u2019ll be honest my genuine interpretation was that she still had some level of interest, was legitimately busy, and some combination of shy and nervous about the cultural context/pressure of our families trying to set us up. I think I could have easily started up conversation a few days later and it would have picked up fine. And so in that regards, I do feel a little bad.\r\n\r\nBut I feel like from an objective standpoint, I had plausible deniability to assume disinterest and disengage. And so this was an easy out for a potential long distance relationship that I didn\u2019t really want to put the effort into cultivating.\r\n\r\nBut some of the relatives who originally tried to set us up was asking me about the situation and I explained that we didn\u2019t have a spark and conversation eventually died out. When I showed them how the conversation ended, they got upset and claimed I had ghosted her. I mean I guess they\u2019re right that she technically had the last message in the conversation to which I never responded to (see above), but I\u2019m not sure if this would actually qualify as ghosting."}, "586": {"id": "eu7bcb", "title": "AITA for calling my brother out for having a party the same day my mum flew home from a trip?", "body": "TLDR; my brother threw a party the same day my mum flew home from an overseas trip.

My best friend, \"Rachel,\" had mentioned his being HIV-positive about a year ago. I'm not sure exactly when he was diagnosed, but I know it was post college (everyone in this story went to the same large university but me), and I don't know the last time he had been tested before that. According to Rachel, he didn't know when/from whom he got it, and was concerned about whether or not he had transmitted it to anyone.\r\n\r\nLeo himself brought up his diagnosis when we first met up to discuss living together. I mentioned that Rachel had told me, and he said he's very open about it, even posting about it on Instagram from time to time. Regardless, the only people I mentioned his status to were my parents. Leo and I found a place together and have lived in harmony since. We haven't discussed his HIV status since that meeting.\r\n\r\nLast night, I had dinner with a childhood friend of mine, \"Ryan,\" who was briefly in town. I mentioned that I was living with Leo. Ryan told me that they had hooked up on multiple occasions a few years ago in college. I had no idea they knew each other. Guessing that Ryan was unaware of Leo's status, I informed Ryan that Leo had HIV. Ryan was unaware and thanked me for telling him, but said that he'd been tested a few times since then and was negative.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I mentioned to Leo that I had seen Ryan and hadn't known they knew each other. Leo asked how Ryan was, but then immediately asked if I had mentioned his HIV status. I said I had, but that Ryan had said he'd been tested since then and was negative. Leo became upset and said that he didn't want to make a big deal about it, especially when they had hooked up so long ago and he wasn't sure if he even had HIV then. I was surprised by his reaction. I apologized for telling Ryan, but said that I felt it was Ryan's right to know. I additionally pointed out that Leo posted about it on social media, so anyone could find out. Leo said his profile was private, the posts were just on his story, and Ryan and most other past hookups didn't follow him. Leo then stormed to his room.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I found a note from Leo that he would be staying with his parents while he debated whether or not he could continue living with me. Before reaching out, I'd really like some feedback from neutral arbitrators. Rachel has specifically said that she can't get involved in any drama between us, and given Leo's reaction to my telling Ryan, I don't feel comfortable talking to any friends about it and potentially making the situation worse. Leo is a good roommate, so I want to patch things up and will apologize if I'm in the wrong, but I don't think it's right to act like I'm in the wrong if I'm not (in this specific situation) for the sake of harmony.\r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA for disclosing my roommate's HIV status to his former hookup?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Leo came back this morning and we had a really good talk. I told him that I'd had no malicious intentions in telling Ryan, and I was so sorry that I had hurt him and wouldn't repeat his status again. Leo said that he wasn't upset with me, that Ryan did deserve to know, and that his reaction was (plot twist) because there were a number of past partners he had forgotten about, including Ryan, and others whom he didn't know how to contact. I told Leo that if anything similar ever happened again, I would contact him before saying anything. Leo said it didn't matter.

She (Grandma on moms side) found this out through senior circles and card clubs.\r\n\r\nHere is the thing, I haven't spoken to my fathers side of the family going on 7 or 8 years. My father is not someone I particularly like. He's rude, mean, I've heard him say slightly racist and homophobic remarks. So about 7- 8 years ago. I finally snapped after he emailed me, and innocent email asking what was the best one (I have multiple) to contact me. I bascially said right then and there I didn't want to have anything else to do with him.\r\n\r\nAs a result he told everyone on his side of the family I wanted nothing to do with them, which wasn't true. I have a sister who is 14 or 15 now on his side I have't had any contact with. My father lives in a different province, but I haven't spoken to my grandmother here, or my uncle on his side either as a result. They haven't reached out to me for birthdays or holidays. They all cut me out when I cut him out.\r\n\r\nI haven't lost sleep over it, I don't really think about him or that side of the family anymore. I have my own stresses and shit to work through.

During the break up, they dated. After their relationship ended, gf and I talked it out and are working on things.  She wants to maintain a friendship with the woman she dated and I told her I need open and honest communication about it.

He has been working at it for quite a bit longer than me, and is an assistant manager. I picked up the job for the summer, and made it abundantly clear when I was hired that I would need to be gone around the beginning of August because I have a vacation planned starting on the 10th and then go directly back to Uni afterwards. However, I gave myself a nice comfortable pillow of about 10 days in between my last day of work and when I officially leave the state for vacation in order to relax, catch up on some personal hobbies, and sort out my financial situation for the semester (note: there is maybe about an hour of \"sorting\" to do, and this time would probably mostly be spent lazing around at home). \r\n\r\nSeveral weeks ago, we started having staffing issues because we lost a lot of employees in a short amount of time due to sheer coincidence and because none of them felt the need to give two-week notices. I was put on opening shift, which requires me to be out of bed at 4AM and work an intense 8-9 hour breakfast (alone on cookline) without a break 7 days a week. I can't have any days off because there is literally no one else willing or capable of doing it. I have been working 55 hour weeks, which is probably pussy numbers for some of you workaholics but I am absolutely NOT pressed for money and doing it out of sheer obligation. My brother and my boss are working upwards of 75. \r\n\r\nI turned in my two weeks almost two weeks ago. Tomorrow is my last day. My boss set me up to train this quiet elderly lady as the new breakfast opener. To put it briefly because of character requirements, I don't think she's ready at all to take over where I left off and I am essentially leaving them without a breakfast opener. Not to mention that we should have started training her a LONG time ago, since I went weeks being the only opener. \r\n\r\nI think a reasonable person would consider staying a bit longer in order to make sure that everything was in order. But I don't know how much longer I can take this shit. I think a lot of people would argue that I don't need to bend backwards for a shitty fast food chain, and that I'm not obligated to stay after my two week notice has expired. But these people aren't corporate machines, they're my overworked brother and my (new) boss who essentially had the restaurant pushed onto his shoulders after the old boss got fired.\r\n\r\nI feel incredibly selfish for this, especially since I will be using this time off from work doing absolutely nothing of importance, urgency, or consequence.

She is a medium-sized dog and they are soul mates. They loved each other from the moment they met. Before he moved in, my dog got a treat when we came in from a walk and she would go to the bathroom (morning walk got a dental\r\nbone, afternoon walk got a small chicken treat, evening walk got a small chicken treat). Now, she expects treats all the time because every time she whines or cries for something he goes to get her a treat. She did not do this before he moved in. Before, when she would cry or whine, I would assume she wanted a walk or wanted to play. She has gained 7 pounds since he moved in and her vet is concerned about her weight. I work all day outside the home, and he is home with the dogs all day (he is a disabled vet). Their dog treats are expensive, and we don\u2019t have any extra money for the amount of treats he feeds her. So we have switched to carrots, which her vet recommended. However, she will turn her nose up at carrots, so he will get lunchmeat meant for my lunch and feed her that. I went to make my sandwich last night, and the turkey was nearly gone. It was a half pound package. I made two sandwiches with 1 ounce of turkey each (I\u2019m on a somewhat strict diet so I measure my food) since buying the lunchmeat, so he had fed her 6 ounces of turkey throughout the day while I was at work. I got angry. I told him we can\u2019t afford to feed the dogs turkey that is meant for my lunch when we have bags and bags of carrots for the dogs. He also leaves full cups of coffee around and half-finished cans of pop, and never finishes leftovers he swears he will eat. I have told him repeatedly that we can\u2019t afford to waste things.

Our dog Lily is an Australian Cattle/Lab mix, who takes medication for anxiety. She\u2019s always had lots of energy because of her breed, requiring a ton of exercise. We bought her as a puppy from a sketchy guy at a gas station. We weren\u2019t sure how he treated her, but she has always been petrified of men and scared of almost everything. If you try to give her a bath, she cries like you\u2019re trying to kill her. I like to only think happy thoughts in my head though, or it\u2019d break me. Anyways... she\u2019s the biggest velcro dog in the world to my wife and I. She has to be with us ALL the time. She doesn\u2019t just sit near me. She literally sits on my foot if I\u2019m at a chair or something. If we leave, and my parents are still here, it doesn\u2019t matter. She will just lay in her crate or whine while staring out the door. And she doesn\u2019t eat too much while we\u2019re gone. Very good guard dog though, if anyone tries to come near the house... you will damn sure know and you\u2019ll think she wants to kill you (it was great when the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses came by... I\u2019ve never seen them leave in such a hurry!).  :)\r\n\r\nA little more background.  We\u2019re at my parents house as a temporary solution because of the timing of us buying a house, and the issues/conditions from the sellers needing to \u201crent back\u201d from us for an additional 2 months after closing. We by no means are \u201cfreeloading\u201d at their house. They offered it up since they have a 4br house and all 4 of us kids (me and my siblings) were gone. We buy groceries for us and them. We cook meals. Clean and pitch in constantly. I pay my parents for us to live here, including the full utilities too. But we are extremely ready to get out for sure, as you can imagine. \r\n\r\nSo the main AITA piece now-\r\nThanksgiving is next week. My siblings are coming in from Florida from today (Saturday) and staying at my parents\u2019 until the following Sunday, so like 9 days. My sister has a little girl and boy (both less than 3). She also has her Shih-Tzu dog and he\u2019s 10 now. My mom asked if we could just board our dog somewhere the whole time, or send her to my wife\u2019s parents house. She thinks that with the two kids and my sister\u2019s dog here, that it\u2019s too much and we should just get rid of her for the holidays until my siblings leave. \r\n\r\nYes, my dog is like 55lbs and her Shih-Tzu is like 10lbs. But ever since my dog was a puppy, the Shih-Tzu has always been the one to try to bite and nip at our dog when we\u2019re all together. He also barks at Lily while she just sits there. When we all visited for Christmas last year, we had to gate off the dining room and our dog was banished there, while we sat on the floor with her a few days because she didn\u2019t want to be alone. She whimpered and just wanted to see everyone too. We put a gate in front of the living room entrance and she was finally allowed to be on a leash inside and she just sat with us all happy from the steps, looking into the living room at everyone. Then falling asleep there like a good girl. \r\n\r\nSo my mom wants us to send the dog away. We rotate holidays, and my wife and I were going to do thanksgiving at my parents\u2019 house this year. Now I\u2019m planning on spending both Thanksgiving and Christmas at my wife\u2019s parents. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think we should have to send our dog off to be alone for the holidays. She would be so torn without us. And we would be sad without her too. I\u2019m one of those people where my dog is my child, dammit. Lily was with me while I lived alone in the middle of nowhere for the first year of her life. She was the one to comfort me and get me through losing my 19-yr old cousin tragically last year. She makes our day better after the long days at work. Lily just wants to cuddle us and make everyone happy. So why do I have to send her off for the holidays, when the whole time I\u2019ll just be thinking about how scared she will be that we\u2019re never coming back?!? Or how I know she will be sad and cry. Why should I have to cast my dog out, that I devote hours a day to every single day to make sure she\u2019s getting the required exercise and attention (getting up an extra couple hours before work to play, and spending hours at night tiring her out)? I worked through her anxiety and biting phase when she was a puppy, just Lily and I. She\u2019s all good now, but she\u2019s just such an integral part of my life and my wife\u2019s, that I feel angry for everyone seeing Lily as \u201cjust a dog\u201d and something that we can just drop off somewhere and pick up when it\u2019s convenient for everyone. \r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not my house, and I know my dog can get excited sometimes to see family she knows, and wants to jump up to say hi. \r\n\r\nSo judge me please, Reddit. AITA?\r\n\r\nTL;DR - live at parents house temporarily, with wife and my 2 yr old dog, who has anxiety issues. Parents want my dog out for holidays, so sister and her kids/dog can be here.

Except they didn\u2019t think to tell me it was to be at my own workplace.

And it would be hard to, they are all really chill people and it\u2019s a great work environment. I much prefer it to my old job at McDonald\u2019s.\r\n\r\nSo this morning I just found out it would be there and already I know it gonna be a riot as it\u2019s NYE and there\u2019s about 10 of us. This is a relatively small cafe but gets very busy especially around this time of year. It\u2019s only really designed to seat 4 people at most except for one table at the back which seats 8 (still not enough). \r\nAnyway we sit down and start ordering but it turns out that there was only 2 people rostered on the floor (2 really lovely people) and it starts getting really hectic around the cafe especially \r\nwith us 10. \r\n\r\nMy step-uncle then complains about the wait of ordering which yes I will admit was but more of a wait then otherwise appreciate but earlier they did inform that they were understaffed. I went up to ask if they wanted me to put on an apron but they said it\u2019s fine since they have someone else coming in soon.\r\nAt this point, another complaint from my step-uncle and Mum\u2019s partner comes about the coffee wait which was aswell a bit longer but still knowing about the understaffment(if that\u2019s a word) .\r\n\r\nAt this point I\u2019m feeling really embarrassed as my coworkers are seeing me more as a customer then a colleague (a particular annoying set of customers at that).\r\n\r\nSo I ask my mum as why we decided to come here and my sister (f24) overhears it and starts an argument about why I care and that she had her friends bday at another cafe so it\u2019s fine. This just made me feel more uncomfortable because now it\u2019s a proper scene.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, she starts mentioning super embarrassing stories about me as a kid to pretty much everyone including the next table overhearing everything and probably my coworkers too.\r\nIt just built up and I told my mum that I can\u2019t be here any more and told my cousin that I\u2019m leaving and promised to make it up to her by taking her out for her bday, just us two.\r\nAnyway yeah, the situation I feel definitely had faults in both sides but I\u2019d like to hear what you guys think.

This confused me but she told me she was sure, and the two days we were together were great.\r\n\r\nThen the arguing started again- and she told me she needed space, and didn\u2019t speak to me for around 3-4 days(we were used to be in almost constant communication). I only saw her at a meal with around 12 of our friends, which she was late to.

On the first night, a big storm gets to our camp and I offer her to store some of her stuff in my tent since mine can sustain heavy rain and hers (which she is sharing with another friend of hers) can't, she accepts since the wall on their tent is wetting everything it touches.

About a year ago we started long distance but it has still been good.\r\n\r\nStarting about 4 months ago she started drinking and getting high with friends, this wasn't that big of a concern to me because I know the friends she's doing with and it is very controlled. I can tell she isn't addicted, she just\u00a0 wants to have some fun like a lot of highschool or college kids do. I have no problem with her doing this, especially because she has never broken my trust. However there's just somewhere deep within me that doesn't want to constantly have the conversation of \"how was your day?\" \"Good I went smoking and drinking with some friends\" so I told her to just not tell me when she smokes or drinks from now on. Just tell me other details of the day because I don't want to hear about that part.\u00a0\r\n\r\nShe asked me if I wanted her to stop because I didn't want to hear about it. I told her that I'm okay with her doing it, as long as it doesn't get out of hand and we talk about other things besides that in our conversations. Well here are where things get a little annoying, she's gets very emotional when she is drunk or high and will call me and spill all her emotions out. For example she will beg me to call then she talks about how she doesn't think I love her and she's scared I'll leave her because I don't love her enough. She mainly feels this way just because of the effect long distance has had on our relationship. She will also still tell me about her experiences after she's sobered up knowing I don't want to hear about it. Her reasoning for this is because she never wants to hide anything from me and wants to tell me everything\r\n\r\nNow I would be okay with this because of course communication is really important and I want to be the person she can always come to no matter the circumstance. But this means that I'll always be hearing from her when she's drunk or high talking about herself being drunk or high when I told her I don't want to hear about it. And also she will call my very late at night sometimes to have these discussions. I'm working\u00a0 full time over the summer and also studying for my college classes for the upcoming semester because last semester I did not do very well.

This is a difficult story to explain.\r\n\r\nMy (18F) sister is about to be kicked out of the house. \r\n\r\nShe is known for doing things to get her in trouble (ie. she almost overdosed on OTC drugs to get high with her friends, has run off while she\u2019s supposed to be at school, basically things to worry a parent extremely. My parents are basically friends with the CPS and officers at this point with her.) \r\n\r\nRecently she broke up with her boyfriend of a little over a year, and she said it was mutual. She\u2019s completely fine while he is not. He looks like he\u2019s going to break down at any minute. \r\n\r\nHe lived with us while they were together, and when they broke up, she basically kicked him out. My father took him back in because he doesn\u2019t have a diploma from high school or a GED (not related at all, but it wasn\u2019t completely his fault.) My dad told him that he\u2019ll be living with us until he gets himself in a good enough job to be stable and he\u2019s going to be okay. The only person not fine with this: my sister. Obviously. \r\n\r\nShe recently asked me (like Friday) to take her to the bus station, because her friends were going to pay for her ticket to the aquarium in another city (not going to be naming that city for obvious reasons). She asked me to pay for the bus fare online because it was the only way to get the ticket early and she lost her debit card. She paid me back for the ticket, so I said sure, and she even offered to pay for gas money. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m a relatively new driver, so my mom wants to know when I leave or arrive at a place for sound of mind. If something happened, she\u2019d at least know the last place I was and where I was going to come get me. I told her early this morning when she asked me to take my brother to work that my sister was going on this trip. My mom almost went off. She told me later that she wasn\u2019t mad at me, but at my sister because she never said anything to my parents. (There was an issue between them early on in the week, and such and such and their relationship is kind of weird.) \r\n\r\nWhen my brothers and I got back from a trip to surprise my parents for the things they do for us, her ex asked my father to call my sister to see if she was okay (she wasn\u2019t answering her phone at the time) and my father told him to not worry because she didn\u2019t tell my parents she was going on this trip in the first place. \r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to tell my father that she was going with one guy she met online instead of friends and the reason they broke up was because she was texting said guy and telling him to not text other girls unless he needed to. \r\n\r\nWhen my mom found out, she grabbed her phone, tried calling my sister and then texted her. My mom told her to come home in 5 hours (the city is about a good 3 hour drive from us) or don\u2019t bother. \r\n\r\nSo are we the assholes for telling her this?

I've done some thinking over the year that we've been engaged and come to the conclusion that I really just want a small wedding, ~60 or so people. We are mostly in agreement, though if she had it her way we'd be walking over to the clerk's office at lunch and calling it a day.  \r\n\r\nMy fianc\u00e9e's family is small; they would contribute ~40 members, but they're easily cutting that number down to fit our guest list. The problem is my parents. They both have big families, but my mom's is more daunting. With three siblings and twelve or so aunts/uncles, her side of the family would make up a sizable guest list, easily 90 people if she had her way. My mom is also the type of person who is close with even tenuously linked members of her family, and she keeps good relations with kin of increasingly slight connection. It's a trait I usually admire about her.\r\n\r\nI've tried having the conversation with my parents about this situation, but they won't hear it. My mom acts like I'm trying to bully her. She doesn't want to cut her list at all; every person I suggest removing sounds to her like an insult. She thinks my wedding will destroy her relationship with her family. My family can be hard headed so there may be some hurt feelings if some people get cut and others don't; it might cause some rifts.  \r\n\r\nThen there's the cost. Fianc\u00e9e and I both work full time, but neither of us get paid well. We're in a high cost of living state and I'm struggling getting myself out from under some foolish credit card debt (nearly there!) and a mountain of student loans. We have to budget ourselves just to think about moving out and making car payments. Looking into it, having a wedding the size my mom would want would put us at around $14k just for the venue and catering, our total cost probably landing in the $20-23K range.  I wouldn't pay that much for one event even if we did have the money. My mom has tried to compromise on this point saying that she will pay for the plate of every one of her family members, but even being generous that would put her at contributing $9K-12K, and my we would be on the hook for the rest. She claims the difference will be made up in gifts. It's possible, I suppose, but not something I want to gamble on. My mom insists that when they had their wedding and were able to afford a down payment on a house out of it; I just don't think that's at all likely for us.\r\n\r\nThe mood in my house is very sour whenever wedding talk comes up. My mom's dreading the day we make our small wedding plans known, because she will be the one primarily receiving backlash for it. I genuinely feel bad for her.

She keeps saying she wants to work here too and is sure she would be good at it, which I find kind of insulting since I had to get an MSc for it while her education doesn't even qualify as university. My contract says 40 hours/week but with no set schedule, basically I come and go whenever I want to and nobody checks it, but I religiously count my 8 hours/day because I'm... a decent person lol (plus, I still gotta keep those results coming).\r\n\r\nAll summer (when she doesn\u2019t teach) she kept making plans on workdays when I can\u2019t attend and when I reminded her that I have a fulltime job now she\u2019d be like \u201cbut can\u2019t you just skip a day whenever?\u201d, and I technically can but also... can\u2019t really. I feel she is jealous of my free schedule and that I can take part in some exciting research while she feels burnt out in her job but sometimes her attitude makes me feel she thinks it\u2019s all fun and games and I\u2019m just a kid with expensive toys.\r\n\r\nSo she had this idea that she wants to visit the lab. I was like \"okay, we actually have an open day event soon, you can come to that and we will show you around\".\r\n\r\nShe got SO OFFENDED at my suggestion. She was like she isn't just some random nobody, I should just take her there!\r\n\r\nI told her it's not possible. The truth is that it kiiinda is but it's complicated and also, frankly, weird and embarrassing in my opinion. The building requires cards for entry so I'd have to check her in at the entrance. I could use it as an excuse to her visit that she is \"in science\" too, profs bring colleagues to visit all the time, but I'm not a prof so I don't feel it's in my right. No one else ever brought family or partners to visit, only on open days. Again, might be only my judgement but I feel she thinks this is just some student playground and not an actual, serious research lab. But it is, and it isn\u2019t for public entertainment - except on the open day, which she is free to come to!\r\n\r\nBut she finds that insulting, so much that on a recent family gathering I overheard her complaining to my aunt \"...and I asked if I can visit and can you imagine what she said?! That I can visit on an open day!\" but all this laughing, jokingly, as if my suggestion was unbelievable ridiculous.\r\n\r\nTLDR; My mother is interested in my laboratory job to the point she wants to visit my workplace, and she found my suggestion that she can come visit on an upcoming open day insulting.

I'd like to have some input on this thing that happened yesterday between me (21F) and my parents. My mom got me and my bf tickets for this show that we go see every year since I'm a teenager. She gets them for almost free through her work, so she usually just takes them every year without asking me. I went every year until now and I always thank her for the tickets. This year, it was on a sunday afternoon : on saturday me and my bf went to someone's wedding so we were out the whole day and came home exhausted and on friday I called work off because I was really sick, on sunday we both felt quite sick and hungover from the day before, and I had work early in the morning on monday. It was also raining outside and it's a 2h commute so we decided to stay home (I don't live in the same city as my parents). My mom texted me to ask if I was on my way to the show, if I was excited and I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I decided to not tell her I stayed home so she wouldn't feel bad about us not going, a little white lie I thought (my mom is very stubborn and somewhat controlling and can give you the silent treatment for months over one disagreement and I didn't feel like dealing with this as it's christmas soon and all). \r\n\r\nSo I text her \"hi !! yes, we're on our way and very excited. I'll let you know when I get there XO\", then on the time it was supposed to start I say \"show's about to start so I'm turning my phone off !\". Her and my dad immediately text me \"Pics for proof that you're there\" which kinda annoyed me so I ignored it since \\*technically\\* the show had already started, right ? 2h later I text them back \"hey the show is over, I couldn't take any pics because we were in the dark and I had my phone off anyway but it was great, we loved it !! Way better than last year too ! We're on our way home now.\"\r\n\r\nMy parents started blowing off my phone saying \"PICS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN,\" \"WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU\" \"LIAR\", \"You think we're that stupid ??\"  I felt like they were overreacting and acting like control freaks. Did they spy on me the whole day or put a tracking device in my phone ? It honestly made me feel uncomfortable, even if I know I'm in the wrong for lying. I'm weirded out by their reaction since they never called me out like that, and I never took pics of the show the years before either.

He's been pretty needy, asking me to plug his phone in, bring him this and that, make him soup, bring him pillows and blankets, shut the windows, open the windows, everything.

Could I have a venti iced chai latte?\" My sister immediately butted in and in an incredibly patronizing tone said \"Um...'Can I have a chai latte *please?*'\"\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the car, I told her not to correct me like that in public and that I thought she acted completely rude and made a scene in public over nothing. She told me that *I* was being rude by not saying please and to not go out in public and act like I was raised in a barn. I told her that she shouldn't complain that I didn't hang out with often enough if she was just going to be a bitch when I did. She told me to go fuck myself.\r\n\r\nNo, I didn't say the word please at that time, but I greeted the cashier with an upbeat tone and was polite. If anything I'm usually one of those awkward people who says \"Thank you,\" whenever a waiter picks up my cup, \"thank you\" when they pour the water, and \"thank you\" a third time when they put it back down. I almost always say please, but I don't think I should feel bad about missing it once because I was otherwise polite.

We met in high school and we've been best friends since. When we had known each other a few years he told me he had a crush on me but I had a boyfriend so nothing ever happened between us and he got over it.\r\n\r\nA few months ago he asked me to go engagement ring shopping with him. I started talking with him about the engagement, asking what his plan was, and he replied that he was going to ask on their anniversary. He thanked me for helping him and I made some joke about how in exchange I wanted godmother. He replied that they hadn't actually talked about kids and he looked a little worried.\r\n\r\nI tried to change the subject and get him back on track but he looked like he was mentally somewhere else. We went to look for rings, but he only said that he \"wasn't sure\" about any.\r\n\r\nEventually I turned to him and said \"look, something's up, I'm guessing it's to do with earlier. Why don't you go home, have whatever talk you and her need to have, and hold off before proposing? It's not like there's a deadline.\" (probably not exact words as it was months ago but that was generally what I'd said). He agrees and heads home.\r\n\r\nA couple weeks later he brings up proposing again and we go to the mall. First store we go in he sees an engagement ring he likes, but doesn't love. It's literally the first thing you see as you go in the door, so it's the first engagement ring he's seen all day. I say that we can come back later if he wants, but why don't we look around a bit first. There are 3 jewelry stores in the mall and 3 more on the high street, and I take him to all of them. He ends up picking a ring in store #4, which he loves.\r\n\r\nOn the walk home he asks me what I thought he should do for the proposal. I tell him that he should ask his girlfriend. He says he wants it to be a surprise and wants my objective opinion as a woman what I would like. I tell him something private, just the two of us, maybe something really cheesy, like a candlelit dinner and rose petals.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the ring arrives. He proposes pretty much the exact way I described. Everything seems fine, but then yesterday he and his fiancee were walking through the mall and he offhandedly pointed out the first ring he liked and said he nearly got her that one. The fiancee then asks why he didn't.\r\n\r\nHe tells her how I helped him out with proposing, and she gets mad. She called me asking why I felt the need to intervene because the result was that he proposed after their anniversary with a ring she likes but doesn't love and in private when she'd wanted public.\r\n\r\nI said that he asked me for help and I told him to ask her what she wanted more than once but he wound up relying on me for advice and at the end of the day I only gave suggestions, it was him who used it as a plan.\r\n\r\nShe said I should have left him to do everything and propose the way he wanted in the beginning, rather than \"hijack it\", and hung up.\r\n\r\nAITA?"}, "636": {"id": "dxt8sz", "title": "AITA for waking my sister up on a schoolnight to do the chore I asked her to do earlier today?", "body": "So, some background information: my (20F) mom is currently away for a month for work, in total she leaves three months a year every year.

I (47m) have two other younger siblings. We are all pretty close but a realization just dawned on me  that my older sister has been a bit of a saboteur all my life. This realization came because of an incident that happened recently. \r\n\r\nBackground: When we were younger, my sister used to be really good singer.  I loved to sing as a child but every time I tried, I was told by my sister how horrible I was at it. My mom backed her up too. So, I always assumed I couldn't sing and that it was a skill one was born with. \r\n\r\n  This stayed with me all my life. About a year ago, I decided this is something I really have to give a shot. I did some research and learned that with enough training and practice one can get reasonably decent at it.   I have been taking lessons for over a year now and have improved quite a bit. I recently sang at a large gathering. People really liked my performance and I got a bunch of kudos for it. I sent the video to my family. My sister called and completely flew off the handle. Telling me that I was wasting my time and that I couldn't sing. She ranted for quite a bit. I told her I was not looking for her encouragement or validation. This is a hobby and I am happy with where I am at and hung up. \r\n\r\n  But then I got thinking. I was taken aback by her reaction. I started thinking back to all the things that have ever transpired between us and came to the realization that she has always been sabotaging me. Not in a super obvious way but very strategically placed sabotages here and there. She would ruin my relationships with some well placed 'harmless' comments here and there. Nip away at my self-esteem at every opportunity. She even had me believing for a long time as children that I was adopted (She claims this was a joke). This has been a pattern all my life. She is not even self-aware to know what she has been doing and will absolutely not acknowledge any of it if I brought it up. She will laugh it off and gaslight me if I bring it up. \r\n\r\n  I don't doubt that in her own way she loves me. I am just perplexed at this behavior since I have had the realization of her sabotaging behavior. On my part, I think I have been great with all my siblings. I am very successful in life and I have made it a point to help them out as much as possible monetarily and in other ways. She has borrowed from me in the high five figures over the years and I have never even asked her to ever repay it. \r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago, I started cutting out all the toxic people from my life.

One of our top choices for apartments had a $50 application fee per person that would be refunded upon denial and I offered to cover S's application fee in lieu of her car insurance payment (She did not have a job or license so I paid her insurance in order to drive her car to and from work as I didn't have a car). This apartment approved our application and gave us our move in date and our lease agreement that we all signed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months before our move in date we had an argument that resulted in H telling me that the group decided they no longer wanted to live with me and I was taken off of the lease for the new apartment and would receive my application fee back.

My only source of income is gifts from the family that I get on special occasions.\r\n\r\nNow, my mother doesn't have a job. She used to, and she is searching for one, but IMO she has too big expectations - she wants an office job (studied political science), but it needs to be part-time, so that she has time to pick up my younger brother [M7] from kindergarten, and - starting this September - from school. But let's be honest - how many part-time office jobs are there?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I asked her what does she need the money for.

I want her to drop it, since it's bad not only for her, but also for me - even barring the health issues, other people including teachers have started to notice that I smell of cigarettes.

They had us go to get suits and the idea is that all the groomsmen and bridesmaids wear different shades of light to medium blue and the groom wears navy. They found a suit shop that sells suits that are identical but come in all different colours. Their son is in a baby blue one, his older brother in slightly darker shade, then his cousin in a slightly darker shade than that, then me in a darker shade than that, and his best man is in a normal shade of blue, with the groom in navy, so it starts really light and gets darker until you get to the groom. I have to admit it looks cool when you get the full effect. It's all a really delicate colour scheme that I cannot be the one to mess up, and as the suits have to be identical aside from the colour they all have to be bought at the same place, and it's just too expensive.\r\n\r\nJust the jacket and trousers come to about \u00a3240, the shoes are another \u00a3100, the waistcoat is around \u00a375, the shirt is \u00a355, and the tie and pocket square come to \u00a325. This outfit, (which I will never wear again after this as it's really uncomfortable) costs more than double my entire wardrobe. The store also charges extra for tailoring, which I think is a rip off when I'm already being asked to put nearly \u00a3500 towards a suit.

I said I couldn't afford it and she said she wouldn't pay for it, when I never asked her to. Our parents asked why she was mad at me and I told them, and they're on her side, saying that I should just buy the suit, but I literally don't have the money. I am barely scraping by, my account is in overdraft, and I don't even have money to buy food this week, I'm having to wait until next Friday, which is payday, and live off what's in my kitchen already until then.\r\n\r\nI think the right thing to do at this stage is to say to my sister \"I'm sorry, I can't afford to be a groomsman\" and bow out.

Over the past few weeks, he has had a hard time waking himself up. He would typically get up himself when the sun rises or set an alarm on his phone, but he hasn't been doing either of those things recently. For the past 2-3 weeks, it seems that he's become more and more reliant on me waking him up.

Having to try to get a grown man out of bed is something that frustrates me, and I've told him this on more than one occasion. At the end of last week, I told him that I was beginning to resent having to wake him up every morning, that I wanted him to set his own alarm in the morning, and that I wouldn't be waking him up anymore. This all came to a head this morning.\r\n\r\nThis morning, his phone's alarm went off around 6 am, which is new. He turned it off but stayed in bed. I got up to use the bathroom and came back to bed. I reminded his alarm went off and asked him if he needed to get up, and he said no. I fell back asleep until my alarm went off at 7 am. As I was getting out of bed, I asked if he needed to get up, and told him what time it was. He said no, so I left the bedroom to get started with my morning routine. I tried to get him up twice this morning after telling him I wasn't doing that anymore, so I decided to just let him sleep.\r\n\r\nHe usually leaves around 7:40 am, and that came and went. He usually is at work by 8 am, and that came and went too. I only went back into the bedroom at 8:20 am, when I'm about to leave for work myself. I told him what time it was, asked what time he needed to be at work, and he said \"20 minutes ago.\" He also told me that his phone died, and that he wasn't happy that I allowed him to sleep in because I resent him. He hugged and kissed me goodbye, but I could tell he was upset with me.\r\n\r\nAt first, I felt like I was serving up some tough love. I thought that if he learned the hard way, he wouldn't depend on me to get him up anymore. I know this doesn't reflect nicely on me, but I had told him how I felt and said that I wasn't going to do it any more. I know that he was listening to me when I told him that, because he did set an alarm this morning (which he slept through), and he repeated the bit about resentment. I did try to get him up twice this morning despite saying I wouldn't do that any more. However, now I feel like I might have been needlessly petty. His job isn't one that would be in jeopardy over being late this one time, but no one looks good coming in to work late.\r\n\r\nSo, AITA who owes my husband an apology, or what? \r\n\r\ntl;dr - Told husband I was beginning to resent having to wake him up every morning. I told him to set an alarm and that I wouldn't try to wake him up in the mornings anymore. This morning, he slept through his alarm, I tried to get him up twice, but he kept sleeping.

I didn't tell them the name of the venue or much about it at all. Just what town it's in and that I really love it. So unless I'm missing something, their only issue is with the drive. I'm assuming that's mostly because they want to drink and not have to make overnight arrangements. The venue isn't in the middle of nowhere so there are plenty of places to stay that aren't expensive. \r\n\r\n2.) I don't know if I'm reading too deeply into this, but it seems like this could be an issue of the dynamics in my family. I'm the youngest of 5 and I'm probably always going to be seen as the \"baby\". From the start, no one took my engagement seriously. Like at all. They insisted I must be pregnant and that's why I got engaged (I'm not). I'll admit I'm young, but I have a full time job, am in a very healthy and committed relationship, we've been living on our own for a while now, etc. My guess is that my family still wants that feeling of control because I'm the young one who isn't capable of making my own decisions.

This is my first time posting and I\u2019m on mobile so I apologize in advance for formatting issues. Also, throwaway account, my friend is an active Redditor. Also, very long story ahead, so bear with me! \r\n\r\nLast year I (F25) met my friend PJ (M31) while we were both studying for our MBA. We became good friends and ended up moving to the same city post graduation. We saw each other like 2 or 3 times a week and became very close friends. During this time I was also having severe mental health issues and often leaned on him for support. He was good about being there for me and often encouraged me to go back on SSRIs. So, with his support, i did go back on meds. Within a few weeks they started working and I started feeling happier and healthier. \r\n\r\nHowever, as the meds got me back into a good mindset I noticed some toxic relationships in my life. I also started noticing my own toxic behaviors and changed myself a lot. This affected my relationship with PJ because I started noticing things about him that made me really uncomfortable. In his defense he always did these behaviors, but suddenly I was like... aware and negatively affected by them. I\u2019ll go into more detail on his behaviors in the comments because of the character limit, but basically I\u2019m recognizing how controlling, angry, mean, and inappropriate he tends to be. \r\n\r\nI recently moved further away and don\u2019t make the effort to see him a lot anymore, which in turn makes me feel like a really shitty friend and person. A week ago I had him over to see the new place and he ended up making some sexual and rude comments that really upset my roommate and me. He also refused to let anyone else pick the movie besides him and when he was ready to leave he told me I could drive him home even though I told him several times before he came over that he would have to Uber. When I refused he was verbally angry.\r\n\r\nI realize I don\u2019t enjoy spending time with him anymore. Obviously this breaks my heart because he is my best friend and I still deeply care about him and deep down I think he is a good person. Without him I don\u2019t think I would have gotten the help I need. But his behavior annoys, hurts, and offends me. He is going through A LOT of personal stuff right now I want to be there for, but he doesn\u2019t seem interested in getting help. He says that this is who he is, that he\u2019s used to not having friends or anyone who cares about him, and that most people leave him and it doesn\u2019t bother him. I think it does bother him but he\u2019ll never admit it, nor will he admit he cares about our friendship, which also hurts.\r\n\r\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for telling him how I feel and ending the friendship if he refuses to change?

To not go too far into detail about it, my dad got involved in my new car purchase and coerced me to go against my better judgement and buy this 2006 bmw that he found online for about the same price instead of the one I had picked out and was going to buy (2007 Volvo S60 R) which, might I add, was in perfect condition. When I looked at the bmw it seemed to be in decent condition apart from some obvious problem areas that I knew would need to be addressed (new wheels, appeared to be an oil leak, needed new driver side headlight) which also gave me a bad feeling in my gut. long story short I end up buying the bmw cause my dad went ahead and out some of my money in as a down payment for it (he likes to eat involved with things). \r\n\r\nOk so fast forward about 6 months and I have so far sunk about 2000$ into this car on necessary fixes that turned out to be big repairs (I\u2019m still kicking myself in the ass for buying this money pit). One thing in particular that still hadn\u2019t been fixed was the driver side headlight. The problem with it was that water had been able to leak into the headlight over years and years causing the clear plastic to be permanently cloudy and also messed up some electrical components which caused the adaptive headlight not to work (turns the lights left and right when going around corners and is a very intricate assembly so can\u2019t be fixed with a simple bulb replacement). Since I don\u2019t have a lot of money being a recent grad and am only working an entry level job, I can only make the repairs once I save enough money and the whole replacement OEM headlight assembly would cost about 5-600$. \r\n\r\nAlso for a side note I\u2019m big on doing things correctly the first time and of course I\u2019ll try to save money when I can but I will opt to spent the extra buck when something really counts and needs to be done right. \r\n\r\nSo a couple of weeks ago my dad gifted me a replacement headlight assembly so I could save the 500$ for something else. The other day I took the old one out and tried putting the new one in. First I hooked up all the plugs to make sure it worked but there was one plug that didn\u2019t have a spot to connect to. I looked closer and realized that these were not the same kind of headlight. The main difference being that the replacement did not have the adaptive headlight assembly inside it and was just a regular bulb (the light from the replacement was yellow and much dimmer than the original passenger side light that was white light) On top of that, the holes for the screws didn\u2019t line up right with the frame and required a little persuasion to fit. Also on the original there\u2019s a separate arm piece that clips into one corner of the headlight and then is screwed into the frame. The replacement had the spot where the piece sits in but not the part where it clips into the headlight itself so it sits in the opening loosely. Without this arm attached, the headlight wiggled around. So now I\u2019m thinking that the replacement is just a cheap knockoff. I told my dad about the light and that as much as I really appreciated his gift I can\u2019t use it cause I\u2019m worried about it coming loose or breaking (being as that it wouldn\u2019t be completely mounted and the material felt very fragile) and he acknowledged. So I figured I\u2019d just take it out and put the old one back in the next day as I was running out of daylight and didn\u2019t feel like fiddling with it anymore (kind of a pain in the ass to get it in/out) \r\n\r\nThe next day I get up around 10 cause it\u2019s a Saturday and It\u2019s the only day I get to sleep in. When I go downstairs my dad tells me that he was able to get the headlight mounted correctly and that he fixed it. When I go out I see that the arm is attached to the frame on the spot on the light where\u2019s it\u2019s supposed to be. I look closer and I see a big crack in the side of the opening where the arm sits and super glue all around it (looked like he forced it in and it snapped). Then I see a big smear of superglue that dripped off the arm area onto the front of the headlight onto the clear plastic that had been partially wiped but looked like it was wiped off a bit too late and managed to dry. So now not only can I not return the replacement headlight because it\u2019s damaged but I\u2019m pretty much stuck with it. I told him that I appreciate him trying to help but as much as I tried to not get mad I got pretty upset at him doing things to my car without my knowledge. \r\n\r\nAITA for trying to give my dad back the gift and getting upset with him about him \u201cfixing\u201d the replacement and rendering it nonreturnable?"}, "687": {"id": "e9opqz", "title": "AITA for not wanting to co-sign or take out a personal loan for my bf?", "body": "My bf (29m) and I (27f) have been together for almost ten years and we've been having issues with money lately.

I know those friends are into stronger stuff and I'm really scared he might end up doing other things as well.

I normally creat short videos but I decided to finally make one large project. So I am currently in the process of making a 20 minute documentary about my last summer in my hometown before I go off to college and leave all of my friends. It features all my best friends so I decided to host a viewing party of the documentary at my house in our cinema room with food and drinks. My current \"girlfriend\" (we don't \"date\" bc she's a year younger than me and we're avoiding it being harder when I go to school a few hours away) has this friend of hers who has constantly caused issues in our relationship due to him being a a drama queen gay guy (not homophobic but felt it may be relevant). They have been best friends for a very long time and he has always shit talked me and put doubt and suspicion in her head for no reason about me and this has lead to the relationship she and I have to struggle for no reason. I believe he does this as he feels as if he is being replaced. I do not like this guy but have to put up with him because its her best friend. \r\n\r\nSo the other day she and I were with some of my friends I recently introduced her to and she has become friends with them, and also this friend of hers is present. The viewing party comes up in conversation and he asks me if he can come since this is his first hearing of it. I go quiet while I try to think of how to nicely say \"no\" and before I can respond she (my \"girlfriend\") says \"If he can't come in not coming, we're a package deal\" (They are bestfriends and spend lots of time together so many times when I am with her he HAS to be there). I proceed to say \"Ive already promised the only 8 seats in the room to my friends that are featured in the video more, if I had a seat for you then of course but, I'm sorry there's simply not room\". A pause happens and then one of my other friends gets uncomfortable so he changes the subject and things continue (we were all playing volleyball at the lake). She was on the other team and starts making comments towards me for not being a very big guy (5'5\" 120 pounds). One of the few things I've always been somewhat insecure about for my whole life and will continue to(she knows this). I remain silent and continue playing. She proceeds to make more comments saying my video is \"going to be shit anyways, your summer was lame anyways so wtf are you even making this for??\" and more comments like this. She decides to ride home with her female friend that was also there because she was spending the night at her house.\r\n\r\nI head home and decide that her friend is 100% not invited now.

I live in Tennessee and my dad moved back to Ohio a few years ago to be near his parents and siblings as they age, plus my sisters and I are all grown and scattered about. So I\u2019ve seen my dad maybe 7-8 times in the last 3 years, and even though we aren\u2019t super close, we get along and I love the old man.\r\n\r\nWe also have one big thing in common: football. I grew up watching Ohio State games with my dad every fall. We\u2019d always grill out and have a great time, but I haven\u2019t been able to watch a single game with him since he moved away. Because of this, and upon discovering the Ohio State-Michigan game (biggest game of the season for either team) falls on Thanksgiving weekend, I thought that would be a perfect time for my daughter [6F] and I to make a trip up.\r\n\r\nThis past Friday rolls around and my younger sister Liddy [20F] calls me to chat. I hadn\u2019t made any decisions about Ohio at this point, just some general thoughts on the idea, but I figured she might want to go if she didn\u2019t have any other plans. So I ask her if she\u2019d go if I finalize plans.\r\n\r\nWell, turns out my 3 sisters were out to dinner a few weeks ago and Abby [25F] tells the other 2 that our mom [56F] is planning to use Thanksgiving for her wedding reception with her new fianc\u00e9e [~65M] because she anticipates us all being there.\r\n\r\nThis rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons.\r\n\r\n-She plans to commandeer a big holiday to make it about her and her marriage.\r\n\r\n-She only told Abby and the rest of us only know because she\u2019s spilling the beans (because Abby wasn\u2019t told to spread this news).\r\n\r\n-She expects us to be there without clearing it with us first.

Also she pointed on my double chin, which she said was big and I should get rid of it. In reality, I am average looking girl, slim but with oval face and my double chin isn't big, it's more about the form of my face. Firstly I wasn't surprised with her words because she attacks me like this from the very childhood. When I was small I was \"stupid\" for her, after I started to show good results in studying I became \"ugly\" and \"lazy\". So, this time, I just asked her to leave me along, as I have almost got rid of all complexes concerning my appearance and just did't want to earn some new ones. But than she started crying for no reason, she said that she did it because she wanted me to be beautiful and I should be grateful for this (yeah for complexes, many of them). I understood that it was manipulation and just went to my room to listen to music. After a while, she opened my door and said that I should apologize because children mustn't make parents cry. Of cause, I refused. Than the conflict escalated. She called me ungrateful and I called her selfish bitch. She tried to punch me for that, but it is not the same as to punch a five year old, now I could stand for myself and she failed.

I succeeded and if I receive visa, I will be studying in Germany. Firstly, it was decided that my family will give me money for living there and I intend to find the part time job to not rely fully on my family.

I was a little bummed, but I understood that he wasn\u2019t feeling it and just wanted to go home and go to bed. \r\n\r\nSo I had a long and stressful shift and I just wanted a beer but I didn\u2019t really want to hang out in the environment that I was just in for the past 8 hours, so I went to the bar my bf and I usually go to when we go out.

He said I should\u2019ve just gone home and that it wasn\u2019t safe for me to go alone, and Saturday nights are rowdy and people fight there all the time. I brought up that he\u2019ll often go there and have a beer alone and he said it isn\u2019t the same. He\u2019s irritated and has been giving me one word answers all day. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m a little irritated at the double standard.

Shortly after I started middle school the family computer broke, no problem there\u2019s an office room. The office room is below the bathroom, a pipe in the second floor breaks and the ceiling crashes down ruining the computer room.\r\n\r\nSo now I\u2019m stuck with the living room computer my grandparents have. For both school and entertainment use. My grandmother is very old fashioned and tends to go to bed at around 10. Maybe 11 if she\u2019s feeling feisty.\r\n\r\nMy grandpa would  fall into routine. After helping her to bed he would stay down stairs and watch TV until 2 am.

It didn\u2019t matter if it was a school night, summer vacation, whatever day it was. It\u2019s his daily ritual, and while I\u2019m not one to normally judge over the years. Literal. Years.

At first, I (22F) lived with 2 guys in their early 30s. We had a great symbiotic relationship and went on great together, going out to picnics, parties, drinks etc.\r\n\r\nAll is great up until 5 months ago, when the main tenant of the house (one of the two flatmates), let's call him Dimitri, announced that he'd be renting out the small spare room to some guy, as a favor to the local Catholic priest. Dimitri has strong ties with the church, and always helps out in any way possible despite not being particularly religious (something to do with the church's influence in the Greek community of the Dutch city we live in. I, my flatmates and this new guy are all Greek).\r\n\r\nApparently, this guy is in his early 50s and works as a church restorator. So far so good, I was even excited since I like the topics of restoration, refurbishing etc. Dimitri says that this guy will be staying with us for about a month, and will mostly be using the room to sleep, as he's too busy working in the church. For the purposes of the piece, the guy will from now on be referred to as Smelly Bastard (SB for short)\r\n\r\nThe day comes when SB comes by to collect the keys. I am in the kitchen doing my thing when suddenly a cloud of b.o. enters the room, followed by my flatmate and some organic blob. His longitude and latitude are at a 1:1 ratio, seemingly comprised of 1 large orb for a body, and one slightly smaller orb for the head. All face and head hair seem to have migrated towards his chest, leaving his head completely textureless. He does not acknowledge my presence, as he is too busy stating his opinion on why the Greek economy crashed (apparently the Germans' fault)\r\n\r\n1 month became 2 months, and 2 months became 3. The move-out date kept getting pushed to later dates, with excuses about his project not being finished yet. At this point, it has been 5 months. He is contributing minimally on rent and house supplies, his room stinks from meters away, and he never helps clean. The other flatmate took this opportunity to move in with his girlfriend, so now it's just Dimitri, me and SB. \r\n\r\nDespite his blatant apathy for basic hygiene, having no manners, and his refusal to understand how to use a toilet brush, my one request for SB is not to smoke in the house (it's been a house rule since before I moved in). All other flatmates and guests have respected this house rule, except for him. He decides that it's better to crack an opening and smoke through the kitchen window, which not only makes the kitchen smell bad, but it also makes it cold in the house. I have repeatedly asked him directly and through Dimitri to stop doing this, but he refuses to comply.\r\n\r\n2 weeks ago, I went to the kitchen and found him smoking again. The conversation went a bit like this:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nme: Don't smoke in the house, you should go outside.\r\n\r\nSB: It's cold outside\r\n\r\nme: Go smoke outside\r\n\r\nSB: I'm not taking directions from you, It's cold outside\r\n\r\nme: You should wear some pants and go smoke outside (he insists on wearing bermuda shorts at all times)\r\n\r\nSB: Leave me alone, I'm not going outside\r\n\r\nme: You're going outside\r\n\r\nSB: No\r\n\r\nAt this point, I am on the brink of a mental breakdown, so our voices keep getting louder until we are both shouting\r\n\r\nme: Everyone in this house respects this rule but you. YOU ARE RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL, AND YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US\r\n\r\nSB: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? \r\n\r\nme: YOU'VE OVERSTAYED YOUR WELCOME, YOU HAVE NO RESPECT AND YOU'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DIMITRI'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHURCH.\r\n\r\nSB: HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT\r\n\r\nme: GO FUCK YOURSELF\r\n\r\nSB: NO U\r\n\r\nAt that point, Dimitri gets involved to try and figure out what happened, and I state that either SB finally leaves, or I will, all the while SB is making comments about me having a bad upbringing, mentioning how my parents did a shit job at raising me etc.\r\n\r\nDimitri agrees with me that SB has overstayed and smells fucking horrible, and has agreed to kick him out in early February, but is upset with me for not having controlled myself better in that situation.

He had a pretty toxic childhood which possibly explains his current behavior.  My sister and Ryan are constantly fighting but typically tend to keep them to herself (except for some occasions when she begs to stay the night because she can\u2019t handle being around him) cool. Their life, their problems. Ryan doesn\u2019t work And always finds and excuse not to help out with his family, and let\u2019s my sister do everything for him.

She refused to listen to me when I said I wasn\u2019t interested, and insisted I was lying that I had no recollection that he was even interested in me. Discussions about dating and guys in general have been something to tiptoe around since.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we organised for available bridal party members to hang out and have some drinks. I said I\u2019d have 1-2 ciders and sober drive home. My friend kicked up a massive fuss over this, and wouldn\u2019t accept my drink choice as I \u201cwasn\u2019t letting my hair down\u201d and she kept trying to pressure me to drink more, ignoring my reasoning for why I was happy to have what I\u2019d said. I attended the event, pretended all was good and drank what I comfortable with.\r\n\r\nAfter the drinks kerfuffle, I decided to take some headspace. I was grieving my grandfather\u2019s passing, and I have been one \u201care you ok?\u201d away from bursting into tears for a while now. I didn\u2019t want to risk another stressful event with my friend when I was already overloaded.\r\n\r\nBefore I left for a work contract over Christmas, my friend asked if I \u201cwas still mad about the drinks thing\u201d and I explained how I wasn\u2019t mad but found it stressful and was taking some headspace from her (and people in general) during this very stressful period.\r\n\r\nShe just blew up and essentially told me I wasn\u2019t justified to feel stressed about the drinks incident or her forcing me on her brother, that I was creating drama out of nothing, and that I shouldn\u2019t need to take headspace from a friend. She insisted she was being a good friend by trying to force me out of my comfort zone re:dating/drinks, that she does this with all her friends but I\u2019m the only one with an issue, and that I\u2019m not accepting her for who she is by having an issue with this. She has also used the proximity of her wedding and my position in it as parts of her reasoning of why I\u2019m TA.\r\n\r\nSo, AITA for taking some headspace?\r\n\r\nTL;DR I took headspace from a friend because she was adding to my already overwhelming stress but she thinks I\u2019m being a drama queen and I shouldn\u2019t need space from a friend.

That was kind of shocking for me, even though I wasn't technically a child anymore. They never even argued and I didn't see it coming.\r\n\r\nWell my dad came out as bisexual last year, when he also got a boyfriend. I don't know if that was the reason for their divorce. My mom says it's complicated and they always beat around the bush when they try to discuss the why's with us.\r\n\r\nI'm still trying to accept my dad's dating someone new. It's weird enough seeing him with someone else, without the fact that it's another male. Not only that, but practically a boy.\r\n\r\nSee, my dad's 47 years old and his boyfriend's only 3 years older than me: 22.\r\n\r\nThe one time I accidentally ran into my dad's boyfriend, when they came over to drop off something for mom, we had a really awkward conversation. We realized we attended the same course at the local uni. Different groups, so we never met then, but that was still weird af for me.\r\n\r\nNormally when my dad asks me to come hang out when his boyfriend's around, I find some excuse. However he recently confronted me about avoiding the two of them and I told him the truth.\r\n\r\nI feel uncomfortable because a) I feel like a bunch of difficult things happened all of a sudden without me having time to process it and b) his boyfriend being that close to me in age makes everything so much weirder.\r\n\r\nMy dad wasn't really happy.

Basically Peter (M, 19) and I (F,18) ere good friends, had feelings for one another, had sex once, then mutually ghosted each other. I don't know what happened between us, but inevitably it has been an unspoken subject. No one else besides one other person knows this occurred, that being my boyfriend (M, 19). To say Peter and I are on good terms wouldn't be inaccurate, however there is a weird tension between us which I would not call sexual.  All in all, Peter was never my boyfriend. This also all occurred before my bf and I started to become romantically involved.\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend is aware of Peter and I's history as we were platonic best friends at the time, so I told him everything. He has made it very clear to me that he dislikes Peter and hates when he is mentioned by anyone due to his knowledge of everything that happened between us, which is fair enough.\r\n\r\nSo a couple nights ago my boyfriend and I went out to a pub to have some drinks with some friends we hadn't seen very often since high school.  When we arrived nearly our whole year was at the venue, so I had a great time catching up with friends. My boyfriend for the majority of the night was either sitting with his mates or playing the pokies, so after a fun chat with the group of boys I decided to give him some space so he could chat with his mates by himself. \r\n\r\nI was venturing throughout the pub with one of my friends, running into many familiar faces. My friend and I spotted our group of friends, both boys and girls, and went over to sit with them on these high stools on this table. The seating arrangement looked like a midway game of connect four, empty seats resting randomly between our group of 20 . The whole group was chatting for about 10 minutes before this guy (we shall call him Peter) came over. Peter sat next to me and greeted me warmly, squeezing me in a tight bear hug. I was extremely uncomfortable with it but drew it up to be a product of intoxication, so I kind of wiggled him off quickly. Peter had slurred that I looked beautiful and rested his hand on my thigh, so I immediately stood up to leave. \r\n\r\nAs I went to turn around and go look for my boyfriend Peter grabbed my wrist, and when I turned roundly boyfriend was a few feet away with a scowl on his face, but he was scowling at me! He stormed off and I followed him, my bf was drunk but the main ideas he kept relaying over and over were;\r\n\r\n* That it was over between us\r\n* That I chose to sit next to Peter and knew how it would make him (bf) feel\r\n* I should have not allowed myself to be in a close proximity where Peter could touch me \r\n* That  I should not have acknowledged Peter's existence.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when my bf was sober he apologised for saying it was over between us but maintained the other three points.

I'm a busy mom and really immerse myself in their school, activities and such. We moved half way across the country when my husband and I got married. My mom was not thrilled at all about this. I promised to visit her at least once a year  by rotating holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas. She promised me she would come visit me too. I can count on one hand how many times my mom has taken the initiative to visit me since my husband and I got married 11 years ago. \r\n\r\nThis year we are supposed to go visit her at Christmas. It is a big deal to take my huge family across country to see her. We have to drive because she doesn't have anything for the kids to play with, car to drive, places for the kids to sleep and so on. So I pack up our trailer and take all of our crap with us. \r\n\r\nMy mom likes to \"play\" I guess. Since she divorced my now passed away father she dates a lot and does her little beauty rituals for herself. I am not judging at all...if she wants to,...she can go for it! However, she always complains she is broke. I asked her specifically to come visit this summer. I have asked and begged. Even offered to pay for a plane ticket. I get the \"I am broke.\" Or \"can my boyfriend come too?\" I am not paying for his freaking ticket for who ever she is currently dating. Sorry not sorry. \r\n\r\nSo far she has been to the Grand Canyon and a trip to Canada with her boyfriend this summer as well as a big wedding trip back in the spring. \r\n\r\nI have had it. She never wants to see my kids, only me really. She was never excited for me to have kids anyway. The only time she says she misses them is if her boyfriend is around so she can show off her maternal grandma side for show. \r\n\r\nI've decided I am not dragging my family out for Christmas if she doesn't come visit this summer. I am also taking back the whole, \"I will pay your ticket.\" Thing too. \r\n\r\nI am trying to do the whole golden rule thing and do unto others but over 10 years about it being about her, I'm a little over it. \r\n\r\nDoing it one holiday though.... am I the asshole??

I\u2019m currently in my last semester of college and he\u2019s currently in his first. My mother is strict and quick to criticize me and babies my brother. My father is the distant but caring type however he hates arguments and won\u2019t stand up for me even though he knows it\u2019s wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother was raised westernized while I was traditional Asian culture. He\u2019s very dependent on my parents and me and it\u2019s getting on my nerves. My mother never expected nor asked him to lift a finger when he was younger. He never had to help with the family business (I\u2019ve been helping since 8th grade til now), was able to go places (bc he\u2019s a boy and I\u2019m a girl), he got his car young, gets to go to parties, and laze around all day at home. My dad always ends up doing his chores just to get my mom and brother to stop arguing. \r\n\r\nLast year when he was 16, he got into trouble at school. He was caught with some study aid drug and got expelled from this top magnet high school. Instead of my mom actually punishing him (like she would me- whipping, kneeling or even being grounded), she gave him a lecture and said the trauma of being expelled was enough. \r\n\r\nI thought this would teach him a lesson in being more grateful of his parents and sister but his attitude just keeps getting worse. He bullies me with his words and always taunt me, actually did physically hurt me a few times, and rude to my parents. My parents dismisses his behaviors. \r\n\r\nHe is irresponsible with his time and money. He spends all day sleeping and then he\u2019s up from 7pm-3am playing games w/ his friends. He recently wrecked his car and wants me to put some of my savings towards fixing it and while it\u2019s getting repair he wants me to chauffeur him around..

I want to move out and limit my interactions with them because they give anxiety and stress. Every time I talk to them they either guilt trip me for money or criticize me. \r\n\r\nMy brother told me I was an asshole because family is family and I should support them no matter what. So would I be the asshole if I just leave? Is it really just me making a big deal?"}}
