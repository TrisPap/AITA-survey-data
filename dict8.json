She moved in with my grandfather, his wife and their 24 year old daughter who my sister is really close with. I don\u2019t hang out with them much because I don\u2019t feel like I can be myself around them, I smoke pot instead of drinking and I also smoke cigarettes never in front of them though because they are so judgmental. They are the type of people that think they are better than other people and and spend tons of money on material items. \r\nMy sister has become more and more like them, judgmental and materialistic, she is even dating the brother of their daughters boyfriend. \r\nA couple weeks ago we got into an argument because she said she couldn\u2019t go to the 80th birthday of our moms step dad because she couldn\u2019t ask for anymore weekends off because she\u2019s been going on to many trips (that have been paid for by who she\u2019s living with).  We got into an argument me saying that she\u2019s prioritizing them because they spoil her and pay for everything, and that she\u2019s forgotten about everyone who took care of her growing up (which was not them, they only recently started helping her), I told her she needed to grow up and stand on her own two feet and not expect other people to take care of her because she\u2019s 24 now. \r\nShe lost it on me and basically told me I was wrong, I told her she was being a cunt (the only name she really hates being called) and to call me when she was ready to have an adult conversation. \r\nShe told my mom she wasn\u2019t mad but was upset I called her that name, I texted her a few days later and and said \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for how I feel and some of what I said, but I am sorry for calling you a cunt\u201d. She texted back saying that isn\u2019t an apology and hasn\u2019t talked to me since, it\u2019s been about three weeks. \r\nNow we are going camping this weekend and I need to know if AITA so we can hash this out.\r\n\r\n*more info* I apologized for calling her a cunt because you are right, I did do that to be mean. \r\nI don\u2019t feel I am jealous because my husband and I have a good life, we even offered her to live with us rent free until she got on her feet. Also to add I basically raised this child after our parents divorced when I was 13 and she was 7 and have really only seen her in the last 6 months when she drops her dog off for me to watch.\r\nAlso this camping trip we are going on is on our calendar until our dad cancels it. It\u2019s a trip we go on every Labor Day with him and his friends."}, "1764": {"id": "cx3e6e", "title": "AITA for refusing to go to any of my best friend's parties/events because I don't want to hang out with his girlfriend?", "body": "I (25F) became friends with Alex (23M) when we worked together a year ago. He left the job after a few months but we still talk on the phone and text three or so days a week.\r\n\r\nAlex has been dating his girlfriend, Emily (26F), for about two years. He's cheated on her probably a dozen times. I've told him repeatedly that his behavior is totally fucked up - he needs to break up with her and then he can do whatever he wants. He feels like that that would be too hard logistically since they live together, share expenses, and she's really good friends with his sister. \r\n\r\nOn the four or so occasions I've met Emily, she's been cold and for a lot of the time she will only speak to Alex. She won't ask me or my boyfriend, Luke (25M), questions and doesn't seem to listen when we offer up information about us. It just seems like she doesn't want to be there. Alex told me that she has anxiety about meeting new people, so she and I should just keep spending time together so she can get comfortable. But I'm an introvert and constantly putting myself in a situation where I feel like I have to keep being nice and trying to engage someone who doesn't like me is exhausting. And it didn't seem like Emily was just nervous - it seemed like she just plain old didn't like me.\r\n\r\nAlex invited me to dinner parties and game nights but I made excuses about being busy because I didn't want to see Emily. Alex is really proud of his events - the themes, the food he makes, his hosting skills - so he takes it pretty personally that I turn down all of these invitations. When he finally pushed me for a reason I told him that I love spending time with him but just don't feel that way about Emily. He ghosted me and I gave him space for a while but after a month I texted him, \"I miss you and I want you in my life.\" He responded that he felt the same way but that when I said I didn't like Emily, he didn't know how to respond. He lives with Emily and she's a big part of his life, and he felt like he would never refuse to hang out with Luke, so it was unfair when I wouldn't hang out with Emily.\r\n\r\nSince the first reason I gave didn't go over well, I told him the other reason I'm not going to hang out with her: while it's his life and he can make his own choices, I don't think he's treating her right and I feel like he can't make me his confidant and then expect me to be friends with her. Alex apologized for putting me in that position and making me feel pressured to lie for him so I thought that he accepted this second reason and would no longer try to get us to hang out.\r\n\r\nBut... that was not to be. A few days ago Alex invited me to a barbecue at their house on Sunday and I declined. He didn't respond for a few days then sent a very long text about how sad he was and how he feels like if I won't go to his events and be part of his life with Emily, it's because I don't care enough about him. Basically it feels like he's made an ultimatum about our friendship.

While I moved out at eighteen years for university and haven't lived at home since, he dropped out of community college after his first semester and has been working various dead-end jobs since.\r\n\r\nHe spends the majority of his free time in his bedroom, smoking pot and playing games on his PC. About twenty hours a week is spent outside of this setting, either working at the fast food restaurant he's employed at or shopping for junk food at the grocery. He doesn't help clean, do laundry, cook, or complete any other chores around the household. And while I know this shouldn't have any bearing on the situation, he started identifying as a woman about eight months ago. Aside from growing out his hair and occasionally wearing dresses, I've yet to see him attempt to do anything else that would be considered feminine (ie. wear makeup, shower more frequently, etc.) The reason I bring this up is because it makes my mom uncomfortable to be around, but she's a very timid person that tries her best to avoid conflict. All this in mind, I gave up years ago on trying to convince my brother to strive for something more, or to seek financial independence from our mom. It doesn't help that she enables him too, but that's a different story.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I stopped by my mom's home to drop off a lawnmower I'd had paid someone to repair for her. We were sitting in the kitchen, talking, when my little brother walked in to grab a drink out of the fridge. I made a comment out loud that now that the lawnmower was fixed, maybe he could start doing some yard work tomorrow. Cue him immediately blowing up on me, asking why I always had to start shit when I visited.\r\n\r\nI started yelling back, eventually telling him that he was a freeloading mooch that uses his transgender persona as a ploy to gain sympathy from strangers. At this point we were both in each other's faces, and my mom threatened to call the police unless I left, which I did.\r\n\r\nI talked to my mom on the phone yesterday and she said my little brother was still very upset about our fight. I told her I didn't care what the opinion of that manchild was, and he should grow up if he wants me to actually respect who he claims to be. I know reddit will berate me for my perceived transphobia, but that's not the case.

We were good enough friends to hang around from time to time but not close enough to speak every day or even week.Since high school was over I've talked to him like 3 times on the phone to catch up.\r\n\r\nThis happened last month but my friends still bring it up from time to time. \r\n\r\nI was hanging out with my cousin at a pub and I see Brad walk by on the sidewalk outside with this girl.

Now I know brad is really awkward around girls and he's always lying about how many girls he fucks but it's very obvious that it ain't true.\r\n\r\nBrad and Jane arrive and Jane sits right next to me, instead of him. As we talked it was obvious to me that Jane likes me, and judging by her personality, she's using brad for attention and money in exchange for the hope that brad has that he will fuck her one day. Jane was giving obvious hints, tohching me laughing at my jokes and so on, and we all noticed it. I tried my best to ignore these just so Brad won't be hurt .

I ask Jane personally if she's still coming and apparently brad told her that the plans are cancelled, which was a lie. I realise that he lied to her after I told him I was gonna come so me and jane wouldn't meet again. I didn't make any advances the night before, and I respected brad. And him doing this pissed me off and I told Jane why brad told her that. We chatted online, and we're very compatible I guess. \r\n\r\nNight comes around and to brad's surprise, me, my cousin and Jane appear . He was embarresed of course and left early.

Earlier on in our relationship we were pretty kinky and had a lot of group sex. We had sex with his friend a few times, and my boyfriend was pretty open about the fact that I could have sex with his friend when he wasn\u2019t there. He told me this actually turned him on, and he would like to hear it about it later. But we weren\u2019t necessarily in an open relationship, and this was something he was only okay with happening if he knew it was going to happen. So we planned a time for me to have sex with his friend when he wasn\u2019t home, my boyfriend came home later and we all shared a bed. The next morning, my boyfriend left for work and this friend stayed. His friend wanted to do more stuff the next morning, and I had realized that it wasn\u2019t something I necessarily wanted to do outside of my boyfriend and i\u2019s relationship. I tried to leave the house to give him the hint that I wanted him to leave, and his friend actually was like \u201coh go ahead I\u2019ll lock up later when I leave.\u201d This was the last of many sexual interactions I had with this friend.\r\n\r\nThis friend also has a habit of coming over to hang out and then randomly throwing on us that he wants to spend the night. He never really asked ahead of time, and almost always I was guilted or thrown into saying yes by my boyfriend. Not to mention when my bf and I went to go spend the night at his friends actual home it was DISGUSTING. I\u2019m talking cobwebs, dirty condoms, trash, clothes, and dust everywhere. I started feeling really uncomfortable with our sexual relationship towards this friend. I did not want to be fluid bound with this person who did not live in a way that showed me he was taking care of himself, and often overstayed his welcome. This friend ended up moving away and it\u2019s been like a year since I saw him. He moved back into town and he keeps asking to come over late at night. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried explaining myself to my boyfriend. That I\u2019m not necessarily comfortable being around him since we\u2019ve had sex, and that I want him to understand my feelings even if they don\u2019t seem justified to him. I tried compromising and told him that he should go somewhere with his friend the next time he asks to come over, but my bf said that it\u2019s his house too and he should be able to have whoever he wants over. I work full time and am gone all week most weeks, so I told him I don\u2019t care if this friend comes to the house I just don\u2019t want to be alone with them both in our home. I\u2019m also really nervous that his friend will ask to spend the night, which will then lead me to having to spend the night with him in my home. I know that he most likely will not make any moves on me.

I called her and asked why she left, when I said I would take her, and she blew up at me saying that \"I didn't care about her, that she would do it for me, that I'm putting her life in danger\".

My boyfriend (24) asked me (21 F) to come over to his friends (41 M) house last Saturday. Let\u2019s call his friend Tom. It was a little uncomfortable already because Tom and friends girlfriend made it obvious that we were kind of intruding because they had other friends there before us and Tom was already very drunk when we arrived (around 10-11 AM). I\u2019ve known Tom for about three years and have heard him say some racist or sexist comments before but I was able to shrug them off for the most part. Tom asked me about college and I told him how I was taking a women and gender studies class but that it was a little irritating that it wasn\u2019t relevant to my science degree. For some reason, Tom decided that this was his opportunity to yell about how feminists all look like men and how women are just jealous because they don\u2019t have a penis, ect. He then got into a tirade about how much he hated black people, using the hard R about every other word. He was almost being nonsensical saying that if historically black colleges exist than white skinhead colleges should exist, ect. and finally just screaming \u201cFUCK NIGGERS!\u201d. I was trying to calm him down when my boyfriend walked over and started refuting what Tom was saying and reached out to put his hand on his shoulder or something. Tom for some reason thought my boyfriend was being aggressive and basically threw him across his kitchen towards the corner I was standing in, I put my forearm in front of myself to brace for the impact. It hurt and of course my arm is now bruised. Tom has come over to our house multiple times since then against my wishes to try and sell a motorcycle we\u2019ve been storing in our garage for years for him and did not apologize, in fact he would not even acknowledge me at all. Tom works at a family company my boyfriend is a manager at and that his brother owns for over 22$ an hour (yes, this is high pay to a college student) also in a managerial position. I did asked my boyfriend to do some kind of reprimanding as his friend physically injured me and was literally saying hate speech. The company gets most of their employees through DOC and temp agencies, so they do fire and reprimand people super often for much less. I feel very uncomfortable with my boyfriend not doing anything about this, and I\u2019ve wondered to myself if he and his family think of me as inferior like his friend does. My boyfriend says that his friend did not mean to hurt me, was drunk and did not directly strike me, and that there\u2019s nothing he can do.

Yes we had a bit too much to drink but we were celebrating my friend's promotion. We weren't causing any touble, other than perhaps being loud at times. But let's be real: absolutely everyone and everything was loud. The music was blaring. We were out until the closing time of the bar i.e. around 1 a.m.\r\n\r\nA group of guys and girls seated behind us took issue with my friend kissing his boyfriend couple of times. They kept turning around to check whether they'd be affectionate again so they could poke fun at them and make hostile remarks. As noted, I'm hot-headed as it is; when drunk, I'm practically ready to fight.\r\n\r\nSo yeah... I caused a bit of a scene after the group called my friend and his boyfriend f*ggots. I came over and picked a fight with one of the girls, and I spilled her drink on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe bar manager was called but we all left anyway because it was nearing closing time. The main reason I'm posting any of this is because my friend (the one kissing his boyfriend) got angry because he didn't want me to confront the group. He wanted to give in and leave.

The girlfriend is nice and our dogs got along without any problems. The dog is only aggressive when the neighbor walks it but cool when the girlfriend walks it.  I always offer to leave and let them have the dog park to themselves (neighbor always declines). Every time I run into the neighbor she's been unpleasant. I usually don't take it too personally. I just leave and come back later when they aren't there. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEarlier today, however, I ran into her and her dog again at the dog park. The dog was extremely aggressive.

To paraphrase, she said \"Do you even live here? This is an expensive neighborhood. It sucks that I can't use the dog park because of people like you that shouldn't be here to begin with\". She then asked me a bunch of questions obviously trying to see if I belonged in the neighborhood. I got the impression that she wanted to find a reason to have me banned from the park.

I was mainly speaking to the Year 11 (age 15 to 16) assembly. Had around 150 kids.\r\n\r\nSo I give my presentation on how I made my money and got my business running, and afterwards do a Q&A. I get some questions, but one question is what role I think school played in my success, I told them:\r\n\r\n\"Well, not much....I guess it motivated me to get out of this place. The kids were cruel and the teachers here, and I realize this will sound bad, but they're useless. I'm sure those of you getting bullied here will realize that...these teachers are useless, and I don't give a single one of them credit....only I am responsible for my success. My own sheer force of will resulted in my success\"\r\n\r\nThere were only two teachers overseeing this assembly, but they looked embarrassed and awkward...another kid asked me about bullying, so I answered with my own experience and the mindset I believe he needs to cultivate:\r\n\r\n\"I was bullied by this one kid...noone did anything even after I asked for help. In the end....I had to play fire with fire. I came up with a nasty rumour about the kid...which worked. His mental health tanked and he had to move school...you have to see your enemies as enemies. They're not your friends and people like that don't truly mature. You have to destroy those who seek to destroy you. That's the mindset I took in the business world and look what it's done for me.\"\r\n\r\nI had some of the quieter and shy kids come to talk to me after my talk, and I saw my younger self in them.

Although we are not very religious, we never crossed any Islamic boundary (never ate pork, drank alcohol or slept with any man) and we don't judge anyone who does so, muslim or not, everyone is free to live like they please, I'm only saying this to emphasize that these things can't be expected from us.\r\n\r\nMain story : M got into college this year and met S, they quickly went from being classmates to friends to dating. When they hit that stage, S admitted to M that he did sleep with his ex and other girls in the past. It was nbd for her but she disclosed that this will NEVER happen with her and made sure he didn't expect it to.\r\n\r\nFast forward to last month, S flew to another country to study there for 3 years. Before he left, they sat down and had a talk about what was gonna happen. In the end, they agreed that they will have an open relationship, which basically meant S could have one night stands, the only conditions M had were full disclosure and no emotions involved, otherwise they will break up.\r\n\r\nEverything was fine, until a couple days ago, S called M and told her he had slept with a girl, twice, and started having feelings for her, but he chose M (I call BS on that, sounds manipulative af). Then he revealed that it was a girl he knew and slept with before (he never disclosed that she will be a part of the trip to begin with, which I consider as lying by omission).\r\n\r\nM decided to break up but is now second thinking it, technically she's backing out of an agreement because it was a one night stand and he did tell her he \"chose her\". But the way it happened doesn't sit well with her, it's sneaky that he didn't clearly say she was a part of the trip since he told her about everyone else, and he only told her about sleeping with the girl after he did it twice (it was not a quickie, they planned it and spent nights together).\r\n\r\nI personally stand 100% with her choice and I think he's TA for manipulating her into this agreement to begin with, but I would like to get the POV of strangers.\r\n\r\nAITA ?

There's this guy well call him Mark (actually don't know his real name) who likes to talk to me a lot. All of our conversations have been about school and classes, etc, nothing personal and this has happened every lab we've had. I didn't think much of and just thought he was a friendly dude but today we had a test and we had to sit in certain sections based on our lab sections. I was in our designated section and there were plenty of open seats in ours but Mark chose the one right next to me and started talking to me. All we talked about was the test and if we studied etc. After the test I texted my BF and made a joke that I think someone in my class has a crush on me and he got mad. He said he's gonna start walking me to lab and tell the guy to stop talking to me and if he does I just need to ignore him. I personally don't wanna treat Mark like this. He's nothing wrong and hasn't crossed any boundaries. I also have never brought up that I'm in a relationship because our conversations have never become personal. My BF think that if I think someone likes me I should stop talking to them all together but I don't see it that way. I can't control Mark's actions or feelings. I don't wanna go out of my way and be an ugly person to someone who I think has done nothing wrong. I have 0 feelings for Mark and he's never even crossed my mine. I could also be misinterpreting his actions and he's just a nice guy.\r\n\r\nSo my BF and I continue to fight and he says, \"So if a girl likes me I can talk to her all I want\" and I said I wouldn't want you to mistreat a girl who's done nothing wrong. there's a huge difference between talking to someone who's flirting with you and knows you're in a relationship.\r\n\r\nI should also add that my BF and I have had problem in the past with his jealousy and possessiveness.\r\n\r\nSo AITA and should respect my BF or is he talking this too far?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also there is something off about Mark.

One thing led to another and we started hooking up. I've always been very clear that though I love her more than anyone in this world, I'm not in love with her. This was only physical.

A couple hours later I find someone to cover.\r\n\r\nNot long after my boyfriend wakes up, his friend asks to hang out.

The boyfriend went down to his friend and turned the volume down a bit and suggested they switch back to TV.

K told me initially that her mother agreed to lend her some money, but when K asked for $112 her mother said she would only give her $30. Obviously this leaves, $82 she would still need. K suggested that she still go but only go to dinner, and she would stay at the air b n b from the club, or that maybe we skip the club all together and just party at the air b n b. She also tried to suggest we cook something vs eating out. I told her that honestly I\u2019d rather have her not come because she has a bad habit of insisting to go somewhere knowing she can\u2019t afford it and then sulking through the whole thing. I also told her that I would not be changing any of my birthday plans as in not going to a club, or picking a different restaurant. In response, she said \u201cokay\u201d and I haven\u2019t heard from her since. Today, one of my other friends called me and said that K had expressed to her how hurt she was by what I said. This friend also told me that I was being inconsiderate. I feel it\u2019s my birthday and if that\u2019s what I want to do, that I\u2019m going to do it.

I started a job roughly 10-15 days after I moved in. We never sat down to discuss bills or anything, and I mostly took care of my own necessities. I don't have a car, so often times one of them would drive me to/from work, but it wasn't far from the house, and I mostly took the bus or cabs. \r\n\r\nI feel guilty that I stayed in their house without paying them. I just wish they'd have spoken up. Sometime during the second month, I gave her $150. I also watched her little brother for free when he came to visit and spent about $100 on things for us to do while she and her husband were working that week. \r\n\r\nLiving with them started out pretty good, but quickly went downhill. She and her husband would \"jokingly\" call me a slut in super detailed and degrading ways, and her husband would often say that I'm not important and that they don't actually like me. I'm not a confrontational person, and I had already spoken to them about it. But I stopped speaking up to avoid drama.\r\n\r\nThe jokes were only a part of it. They would often judge me on how I spent my money (I probably spent $350 on non necessities in the two months i was there) even though we never discussed bills. They also left me out of a ton of things like taking my little cousin to a big city nearby and spending two days with him there. They even planned the whole thing in front of me before they left, making me think i was invited too. I cried on the phone with my sister as soon as they left.\r\n\r\nSo it finally comes time to go home, and my last check was deposited after I got home. I said I'd send moneyto help her out on the drive back to KY. I mentioned this to my mother and sister who urged me not to send her anything because of the way they treated me. \r\n\r\nI ended up not sending her any money and spending my last check. Last month, she messaged me asking if I'd gotten my refund back from my student loan and said she only had $20 left to last her a week. She said she wouldn't have asked but that i had never sent her the money I said i would. I told her it hadn't come in yet and that I didn't have any to give her (truth). A couple of days later, the money came in, and i spent it mostly on school necessities, but used some to buy a swim suit. I posted a picture of it, and she posted a story that said something like, \"now I know not to do anything for you.\" I didn't think anything of it until my mom mentioned it may have been about me. I asked if everything was okay, and her response was that she's always struggling for money and that she always helps everyone around her, but no one ever does anything for her. \r\n\r\nI keep weighing both sides of the situation in my head, and i honestly see her side. I feel like there was more that i could have done to help her out, but i also feel that she wronged me enough that I don't owe her anything.

Is she allowed to let herself in whenever she wants as long as she does my dishes or sweeps the floor or something? I can't imagine so.\r\n\r\nShe could have walked in on anything or anyone, and I don't feel the need to come up with a list of potentially embarrassing or revealing scenarios that could have been created.

Recently after a few post-gig beers we got into a heated debate about my favourite band, The Mountain Goats. Dave considers nearly all non-classical /jazz /folk/fusion music to be trash. I was arguing that while their early work is pretty straightforward and doesn't take much skill to play, in recent years the music has become relatively harmonically complex, with lots of jazzy, extended piano chords and use of controlled dissonance to compliment the lyrics, and that he'd probably like it if he gave it a chance. He kept saying they write storybook music for children, which annoyed me. \r\n\r\nThis was maybe a little petty of me, but eventually I snapped and suggested that if you compared TMG to someone like Phillip Glass, who is a worthy 'artist' but a simplistic musician, you might even say that John Danielle is the more talented performer, and that Dave was buying into a lot of corporate classical elitism that the labels encourage to hike up prices. \r\n\r\nDave lost it, questioned my judgement and said I wasn't even a good violin player, which, as I've decided nearly all my spare time and money to my musical hobbies for over twenty years, irked me.

His attention was completely on his phone not the bottle, so it spilled onto the floor and down the sides of the fridge. This is not the first time it happened. \r\n\r\nI told him to clean it up, because i just swept and mopped the house (which he did not help once btw). He said no, its just water. I pressed again because i will not do it. He said no and told me to fuck myself. Ok i told him he\u2019s a POS and went and poured water in front of his bedroom, which he a few hours later did the same back to me. His birthday was in a few days and I was originally thinking of giving him a gift card cos idk what he likes, but i decided to buy a mop because I still wasn\u2019t over his immaturity (still am not). \r\n\r\nThe day comes around, its just me and my parents and one family friend at our house. We cut the cake blah blah, time comes around for the presents to be given. I go after the family friend, and its pretty obvious my gift is not the conventional gift bc i wrapped the cloth part(?? The wiping part, not the pole lol) and i just left the pole on its side. \r\n\r\nHe opens it, and just stares at it and looks back up at me and asks why i gave him that.

Anyway thank you everyone for all your replies, it really put me in my place and also put everything else in perspective. It\u2019s not just about spilling some water, its the fact that I cleaned a house that I dont\u2019t even stay at everyday and my brother barely lifted a finger, and then he came and completely disrespected me when I asked him to do a very VERY menial task. Yes i retaliated in an extremely immature way and have understood that I was as equally a dick as my brother. \r\n\r\nI have apologised to him for embarrassing him and got him a Visa card as his real present lol. Although as many suggested I tell him how i felt about his behaviour, I have done this in the past for various other situations and all have backfired on me. He has an unusually big ego, and is extremely traditional so anything I say as a retort to his unreasonable (imo) actions, I guess is an insult to him so he just tells me I have no right to tell him that. \r\n\r\nWhatever,, I leave tomorrow for uni and won\u2019t be coming back for a few weeks so I might as well just brush it under the carpet to leave on a good note. I have also apologised to my dad for embarrassing him, and mostly to mum - she was really sad at the state of our family, so I felt really bad for her. \r\n\r\nMy dad, my mum and my brother were all born and raised in India, in very traditional households, so I guess that shows the root of their blatantly backwards mindsets. If I had not cleaned the house, my brother definitely would not have, and that meant my mother would have to do it all by herself, because surprise surprise my dad is the same as my brother. I think I\u2019m her only solace, because she knows she can rely on me to do something, because my dad and brother definitely won\u2019t from what I have lived through. She\u2019s technically in the same boat as I am, she just thinks its okay, since she was raised that way. That\u2019s a whole different problem though. Also I\u2019m not going to cut ties with them - I do try distance myself from my brother and my dad sometimes, because we clash often.\r\n\r\nEither way, I\u2019m leaving tomorrow and like some comments have suggested, I am focusing on saving up as much as possible, so I can move out permanently.

Here is where I stepped in and asked Baba what was going on, he said nothing but left the buff dude alone. \r\n\r\nAfterwards, my classmates, who were the main ones laughing approached me and asked me what was up, whilst laughing, I, very pissed off, started an argument that escalated in volume until it was a shouting match. They claim they were doing nothing wrong, being 'mocked' for your muscles is flattery, and they didn't know that the buff dude was being mocked. I, on the other hand, think it is a complete lack of respect to make people uncomfortable for how they look, and I think that they, as figures of authority, because of their age but also because two of the three main \"jokers\" are the school captain and house captains, should not only stop this behaviour immediately but should not participate. \r\n\r\nThey also added that I was an asshole to them last year and they think it's hypocritical for me to tell them off about something I did. And while yes, I agree I was an asshole last year and would tease them a lot, they are my friends and they would reciprocate on a slightly lesser scale, I think the circumstances are different and not comparable, as they don't even know the name of the kid they were teasing.  \r\nTLDR: Last year I and my friends would tease each other, although I would do it more frequently. This year, they are teasing a kid two or three years younger than them, I defend him and get called a hypocrite for it."}, "1814": {"id": "da3xz1", "title": "WIBTA if I finally got back at my brother?", "body": "I'm on the mobile app. So I apologize for the text format.\r\n\r\nSo I've been living with my brother over a year now and I am moving out soon but me (22F) and him (19M) do not eat the same food. Before his girlfriend moved in he barely brought groceries and would eat out all the time but when he would get the midnight Munchies or after he got high he would go into the cupboards and look for my food to eat it. I tried offering solutions by cooking more for us or if he would slip me $20 extra I would even get his groceries for him. None of that worked so I restored it keeping certain food in my bedroom locked up and also keeping very healthy food in the fridge. Sometimes that would not have worked so then I would make him pay me money back for what he ate of my food. \r\n\r\nNow that his girlfriend lives with us, they buy groceries and I buy my own. The deal was not to eat each others food including friends that came over so I as a respectful human being and made sure all my friends know whether I'm there or not what food to eat if they get hungry because well they shouldn't eat my brothers food if they are not friends. My brother's friends in the past of ate my food and I've also made note of that pointed out so I thought this would change a little bit with his girlfriend living with us.\r\n\r\nI went away this past weekend and well when I got back I noticed half my food was gone and my stuff was dranked. It pissed off and I yelled at them both because the food I buy a little more expensive while they buy Great Value food (Walmart). Their excuse was while we were asleep and we did not watch our friends to not eat your food and they brushed it off and did not care. I asked for the money worth and they didn't even respond. \r\n\r\nSo I'm in control of the utilities and thought about raising their portion more to get my money back or just slowly take their food out randomly and waste the same amount?

I turn off the hallway light when I get home, because electricity conservation and lights shouldn't remain on all day, especially where you're not sitting. She works from home, but she hasn't been in the best mental health state since August so I've been cutting her slack. I'm getting annoyed that she literally never leaves and has claimed the living room. She wakes up, goes to the couch for the day and goes back to bed to sleep. Yesterday, she finally left to go get drinks. I noticed her bedroom light was on 20 minutes after she left, so I reached my hand inside to turn it off. Bf and I migrated to the couch since it was a rare occasion that she had actually left. It was NASTY -  pieces of food on the floor and in the carpet, all her stuff strewn everywhere. I swept a bit and we proceeded to watch Mindhunter.\r\n\r\nToday I got home and she ATTACKED. She asked if I had turned her bedroom light off. I said yes. She said why, I said I don't like when lights are left on, it's a waste of electricity and raises the electric bill. She said I had no right to go into her room. I said I didn't go in, just stuck my hand in to turn the light off. She said she came back so drunk and left the light on  to see because she \"fell\". She said leaving lights on all day does not increase the bill, she can't live in a dark house. I apologized and then told her the living room was nasty.

It's common sense to not leave lights on in unoccupied rooms; being \"scared of the dark\" isn't a good reason.\r\n\r\nShe would probably fall if she was that drunk even with the light on, so it's not on me that she fell just because the light was off. Any normal person would come into the apartment and turn the light on.

My mom had a boyfriend during her marriage to my dad and is still with him, and though I've tried to tolerate him, he's manipulative and insufferable. He's has said nasty stuff about his ex-wife and jokes about how my mom being married didn't stop him. My dad is off and on again with a very trashy woman only a few years older than me and every time I see her, she is completely shit faced and rude, and dresses like a cheap hoe at formal events.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, I recently found out I'm pregnant, almost 8 weeks today! My SO and I are very excited, but I would like to get married early enough to fit in the dress I already bought and not have to waddle down the aisle.

And of course, if we were worried about affording a wedding before, now I have to worry about paying for a freakin baby and buying a reliable baby friendly vehicle.

A few weeks later the dog ate a pair of my Ultraboosts (fairly expensive Adidas trainers) that I fought tooth and nail to get. Pissed me off to no end. I asked David to reimburse me for the shoes which caused a fight. He said I shouldn't be leaving my shoes out knowing that the dog eats them. After some deliberation he conceded and told me that he would not cover any other shoes that were eaten by the dog. I told him that's bullshit and the house is more mine than the dog's, he should take the responsibility of what his dog does. The conversation went no further. \r\n\r\nToday I got home from visiting my parents about 4 hours away by car. I came in, kicked my shoes off and took a nap.

We eat dinner and I continue study. Around 8:20pm, after cleaning up my sister(F22) tells me she is going to watch tv right nearby, I'm studying so I ask her to watch tv either downstairs (which is a bigger tv) or her room (which also has a tv). She says no and me and her start arguing, she claims that she can't go downstairs because it hurts her back (she does have a history of back issues but is also on that couch at least once a week) and she can't go in her room because she doesn't wanna lay down. I tell her I can't study anywhere else because I won't be productive enough and I have 2 tests tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThis eventually reached the point where she would turn on the tv and I would turn off the volume control, she tries to block me at one point and I pivot around her with my hands up while she's shoving me. She said I was pushing her but my little sister took a video and it clearly shows I didn't (If you need it I'll see if I can get it). At another point she digs her fingernails into my hands as I'm pulling them away from the volume controls and now I have 2 decently sized cuts on my hand.

We both share a huge workplace that has insanely expensive parking permits - think $500-1000 per year range. The parking permit for my parking lot sold out relatively quickly (\\~2 weeks), and I didn't buy it in time. Instead, I was able to buy a ($200/year) permit that allows me to park 0.5-0.6 miles from my building. Because I drive home every day on lunch, I now have an additional 40min of walking added to my day (10 minutes walking each direction). I acknowledge that missing out on this permit was my own fault (because I wasn't initially sure I could afford it), and now deeply regret it. My bf, however, had his parking permit automatically renew and therefore has the \"good\" permit, which he pays about $500 per year for (I would pay approximately $800 per year for the same permit).\r\n\r\nThe argument comes from the fact that I have occasionally requested to borrow his \"good\" parking permit - on days where it's rainy, snowy, or where I have a ton of meetings/appointments/etc that I need to be on time for. So far this has been 3 days in the last two months. If I borrow his \"good\" permit, we BOTH get to park in the \"good\" lots - my bf just has to swing by a drive-through parking terminal and pick up a FREE temporary replacement permit. This takes him an additional five-ten minutes at the beginning of his workday.\r\n\r\nI think it's not unreasonable to ask him to accommodate me here and occasionally let me borrow his permit. We live together and have been together for 4 years, and because I go home for lunch every day to walk our dogs, he is able to pull an extended workday. (Because I take a long lunch, my workday ends later than his.) This arrangement benefits us BOTH. However, he is extremely upset about me asking to borrow his permit. I have asked him to explain why it upsets him, and he has clarified that it is because it 1) inconveniences him, 2) the parking dept will become \"suspicious\" that he requests so many temporary permits (they won't - I used to work for them and they genuinely don't care), and 3) it's the principle - I had the chance to buy a better permit and now I'm asking him to go out of his way to accommodate \"my mistake.\" He thinks that I'm lying about not being able to afford it - he thinks I just procrastinated on buying the permit (I kind of did procrastinate, I guess? Because I wasn't sure I was able to afford it?)\r\n\r\nTLDR: I want my bf to go five minutes out of his way for something that benefits both of us. He thinks it's ridiculous to ask your partner to go five minutes out of the way. We both think the other person is being insane. Help us understand each other's point of view here.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEDIT: Really appreciate the great responses so far! I added the following comment below about us potentially carpooling:\r\n\r\n\"We have talked about it, but we do work different hours (offset by about three hours) and I have an extremely variable schedule - i.e., occasionally I start my day expecting to work 8am-5pm and end up working 8am - 12pm. We also live far enough away that the bus lines are not an option. I suppose my bf could take the bus, since his hours are not quite as extreme as mine.\r\n\r\nFWIW we both drive zero emission cars, so I feel somewhat less guilty about not carpooling.\"\r\n\r\nThis comment should have said 8am-12am. As in, a 16 hour day. Sometimes I do get off as early as 330pm though, so it's not always a long day for me.\r\n\r\nBoth dogs belong to both of us (although one was his and one was mine before we got together).\r\n\r\nAlso, solely for the sake of this thought experiment...would it make a difference if we were married?

So let\u2019s set the scene here. Me (31f) and my kids dad, let\u2019s call him Steve (32m) have had a pretty tough relationship. Very toxic. Off and on for about 8 years. We have two children together, a 4 year old and a 6 week old. We don\u2019t live together, but since I\u2019ve had the new baby, he comes and spends the night to help me get the toddler to bed and whatnot. However, he doesn\u2019t help at all with the newborn. I have to beg for him to \u201cwatch\u201d her while I so much as shower. He sleeps with our toddler in my bed, while the newborn and I sleep on the couch. When the oldest wakes up, at around 9, he sends her out to me, in turn causing her to wake the newborn up. He will continue to sleep until as late as 1pm, then immediately get up and say he needs to go to work. He works for his parents, so he goes whenever he feels like it. I will note, I\u2019ve been off work since August, and he\u2019s been to work three times during my leave. Three. For about two hours at a time. He hasn\u2019t financially supported me or the kids during this time in any way. I basically tolerate this, because my toddler has been acting out since baby has been born, so I welcome even the help with her. Today, I fucking had it. Steve is supposed to get up and take our oldest to daycare. He woke up at 11, decided he wasn\u2019t taking her, then said he needed to go to work. I will say that when he goes to \u201cwork\u201d, he\u2019s working on his personal vehicle all day. His parents run a mechanic shop. He\u2019s not working, he works on his vehicle then demands his parents hand him over like $40 for no reason. Then comes back to the kids and I, and just sits there while I do everything. He was being rude to me. He asked what was wrong. I said \u201coh, I\u2019m just tired, the baby didn\u2019t sleep well\u201d.. he mumbled \u201coh fuck\u201d under his breath. I said \u201cwhat?\u201d. He said \u201cnow you\u2019re going to fucking fight with me all day.\u201d I took my keys and my purse and just fucking left. The day before yesterday, I \u201cwasn\u2019t being respectful\u201d, so he left me alone with both kids all day. Answered no calls, and only called occasionally to say \u201cwell I\u2019d help you, but I\u2019m not going to help you until you treat me correctly\u201d THESE ARE HIS KIDS GUYS. So, I figured leaving would help him understand how it feels. I\u2019m currently in a gas station parking lot being bombarded with calls, telling me I\u2019m a piece of shit and trash for leaving him with his own kids.

They purchased steel straws for everyone and gave them out as gifts. I think there are much bigger problems that contribute to environmental degradation, but I went along with it with the mindset of \"reducing some waste is better than not reducing at all\". We had a family BBQ at which my parents bought plastic straws for the guests. The straws weren't really necessary as people can just drink from the plastic cups which were also purchased. I thought it was a little funny that my parents were using these metal straws while everyone had plastic cups and plastic straws. When Sarah saw this, she took my mom to the side and lectured her on purchasing so much plastic straws. My mom was visibly upset that this couldn't wait until the BBQ was over. I also saw that day my sisters using the plastic cups while glass ones from my parent's house were available.

He calls himself a cultural Jew and I'm a mediocre Christian. We participate in the holidays and traditions, that's about it. His parents are a bit more religious, but they're not orthodox or devout. They're known for their community work and are overall proud people.\r\n\r\nHis parents weren't too happy about me not being Jewish, but it was his grandma who gave us hell. She used to badmouth me to the rest of his family without even meeting me. When I finally met his entire family, his parents were nice to me. After that, his mom went out of her way to invite me to dinner, shopping etc., but his grandma was still evil. One time at dinner, she was being rude to me as per usual when my fianc\u00e9 completely lost it, instead of apologizing she told me to convert and she won't be rude to me anymore. Worst part is, his family *loved* the idea.\r\n\r\nEven though my fianc\u00e9 wanted to go ''no contact'' many times, I couldn't let that happen, especially not because of me. He always says how lucky he is to have such amazing parents and siblings and I know how hurt he would be to cut ties with them. His parents eventually realized the same thing and they've grown to respect me, but the whole conversion talk never went away. His grandma lives with his parents and she's the one who pressured me the most.\r\n\r\nFianc\u00e9 and I even went as far as talking to a rabbi about our situation and hoping he could give us some guidance. He definitely helped me understand that Jewish families have to ''mourn'' their men marrying non Jewish women, but as much as I respect that, it wasn't enough to justify his grandma pressuring me into converting and his family fully supporting that. \r\n\r\nLast night we told everyone that we've set the date for August 16th 2020, and his grandma replied ''gives you enough time to change your mind so you can have a real wedding''. By real, she meant Jewish. His family didn't say anything because they support the idea and I always tell my fianc\u00e9 to be the bigger man and just let it go, but I couldn't let it go last night. \r\n\r\nWhen it was my turn to thank everyone for coming, I ended my speech along the lines of:\r\n\r\n>And to *fiance's* family, I am never converting to Judaism.

I also hadn\u2019t taken my meds that week and had been really low.

I live with our mum and she has keys to our house. It is not within our family's habit to show up unannounced or to go snooping through each other's belongings. Privacy has always been a huge thing in our family. I normally wouldn't keep it against my sister - not having a set of keys - but there are two problems.\r\n\r\n1. She invites me over often;\r\n\r\n2. She is chronically late.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't mean 5 minutes late. I'm talking 30 minutes late. We would talk about meeting at 5:20 pm at her place for a girl's night and she'd be there by 5:50. I'd say I can deal with that on an average day but last time... uhhh... let's say I needed to use the bathroom. I needed to just let my guts go wild because clearly i ate something bad for lunch.\r\n\r\nAnd she wasn't there by the time I was.\r\n\r\nI text her frantically asking if she has a spare hidden anywhere and she said no.

I kept texting her to hurry and come home to let me in to goddamn SHIT IN A TOILET and not into my pants while running up and down her street trying to find a place with a restroom. And then she texted me, go to a mall. The mall is a 30 minute walk (or a 15 minute run but who can run at that point).\r\n\r\nLuckily, I found a Thai massage parlor whose ladies allowed me to use their in-parlor facility. I came out looking sick and they even offered me tea ;;A;; I've gone twice to get massage there after that as gratitude.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, by the time my sister was actually home, I was mad.

He stinks like rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. I know it\u2019s not a neglect issue, because Chloe\u2019s younger daughter (11F) has never stunk.

We decided to go to the craft store together, and Braden wanted to come. I drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told her her son smells like ass and I basically can\u2019t be around him until he works on his cleanliness.

There have been numerous \u00a0arguments over the years and, put simply, we\u2019re on speaking terms but in no way close. This will be important later on.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing University, I convinced my family to get a dog under the promise I would front the bills. I moved in with the folks to save up money from my new job and we got a beautiful Labrador pup. It was great. Eventually I found that my career path was wrong for me so instead looked to start teaching English abroad. It meant moving away from home but my parents knew I wanted to go and agreed to look after said dog providing I continued payed all her expenses. Of course I said yes.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the problem; there was a discussion before I left as to if she should have a litter. In my mind, it felt like the right thing as to continue her family line the once before getting her spayed. My father especially was keen on having another pup \u2018to keep her mother company\u2019. Due to my work, however, I emphasized that depending on my term time I might not be around. They assured me this wasn\u2019t a problem. Fast forward to today and we have 10 beautiful puppies. Nine of these pups will be sold to close friends or a good family for a one time fee and one will be given to my father (for free). All is well and good except\u2026 my sister just decided that she wants one.\r\n\r\nMy argument: I said from day 1 that my sister wasn\u2019t having a puppy. She\u2019s a first time single mum with a two year old son looking to start working soon for several days a week. That means there will be days she physically can\u2019t look after said puppy. This and she already has a year old kitten in her house that she doesn\u2019t have insurance for. Added in that she previously had several cats that she gave away because she lost interest then it\u2019s my firm belief she only wants this puppy because she thinks it\u2019s \u2018cute\u2019. Puppies, however, quickly grow up. A dog is suppose to be for life and I don\u2019t think that will be the case here.\r\n\r\nTheir argument: Her and the puppy have already bonded. If I don\u2019t give her the puppy then I\u2019m driving a wedge between us, breaking her sons heart, and will also be causing further problems down the line as she has said multiple times that she will hold a grudge against me unless I change my mind. I\u2019m also apparently putting my parents in a bad spot as I\u2019m making them say no to their daughter.\r\n\r\nJust as a last word, I\u2019ve stressed to my father I understand how everyone feels but I physically own the mother dog, I\u2019m paying for all the fees, and until now I had the final say on to which homes the pups were going to.

After Christmas on our way home I asked her about it.  She stated outright that she didn't like them.  While these were things she had asked for I had missed obvious details on what she wanted.  Yes she had stated  she wanted a robe like her sister had gotten but that her sister's was neutral tones and that she wanted something white or light gray instead.t Yes she had asked for a diffuser but had told me to get a small model.  The one I bought was to big.   She said it was lazy gift giving.\r\n\r\nI was pretty upset.  After a heated argument on the way home she left the gifts in the car.  they sat there for a week.  After a week I boxed them up and sent them back.  I asked her if she wanted them before I did and she said I could do what I wanted. After I did we fight about it again. we both end up angry and agreeing no more gifts for birthdays/Holidays.\r\n\r\nFast forward to valentines day.  I plan a dinner out and a walk through a light display in a nearby park.  My thinking is to replace gifts with events.  Nothing material.  I honestly thought it would be a nice compromise. During dinner she is obviously upset.  I ask her what's wrong and she tells me that she was one of only a few women at her work who didn't receive flowers.  I told her we had agreed \"no gifts\" and instead we were going to spend time together and do things.  She said flowers aren't a gift they are a show of love and that I was just being petty.  She stated \\*Quote\\* \"I'm sorry I made you feel bad during Christmas.  I didn't mean to.  But I want flowers on valentines day.\" After that she says that she apologized and that this no gift thing isn't working.  I told her that apology wasn't very genuine and that I was holding to it.\r\n\r\nDuring my birthday I'm to busy to do anything.

I tell her a Band I like and she buys me a bottle.\r\n\r\nHer birthday rolls around and I plan a trip to a local festival she's been talking about and then an evening out.  The day comes, she enjoys the festival, we have a delicious meal and come home late.  When we get home she asks for her gift.  I tell her we agreed almost a year ago no gifts. She says I'm not showing her love or respect by being so spiteful.  I point out the agreement.  She states that after valentines day the agreement was off. From her view she had apologized and we should move one.  She yelled \"haven't I paid for Christmas enough yet\".  She reminded me about the bottle of liquor and how I had asked for it.

And because it\u2018s so normalized, I assumed that it\u2019s okay (or at least, not harmful). As time went on I began doing research and processing what it could mean when he watches it and became increasingly uncomfortable with it. I brought it up a few times in our dating relationship but it always ended horribly.

He tries to be rational in everything he does, so when we talk about it, he breaks down the logical implications of him doing everything I want for him, which apparently leads to a sexually dissatisfying life. To me, his \u201clogical breakdown\u201d fees like he\u2019s blaming his porn habit on my inability to please him, and when I defend myself and say that it isn\u2019t okay to put this on me he goes to the other extreme. \u201cI will do my best to get my shit together and not bother you in the process\u201d was his response to me when I said that this shouldn\u2019t be put on me.\r\n\r\nI should point out that I want to have more of a sex life.

A few weeks ago we had a long talk about the situation while cuddling on her couch and decided to try staying friends. I flat out told her that I want to have sex with her, and we talked about various sex-related topics for a long time while sitting very close together, so she's 100% aware. That's the backstory.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking I brought up that I've always wanted to ask her to go to the sauna with me. She told me she would've said yes, so I just asked her if she still wanted to go. She said that we should wait a bit because of the situation, but, long story short, we went a few weeks later. Now this is more like a spa where you stay for the whole day and don't wear any clothes while going to various saunas and water pools. So basically we spend an entire day naked together. At first it was weird, but then it just felt normal... until her boyfriend started texting me a few days later.\r\n\r\nHe was furious, asking what the hell I'm doing with his girlfriend. He wants me to 'stop being a creep' and don't ask her out again. I have not answered yet, since I'm not sure who the bad guy is in this situation. I do understand why he didn't like this.

He told me that was not fair because he was spending \"so much time in transit\" flying across the country (5-10 hours one way, depends how you fly) and that \"the person being visited should front the majority of the costs\". He also labelled me greedy. When I told him that if he cared about me, he would just pay for his flights in full, he called me manipulative.\r\n\r\nIt's a huge amount of money for me and I don't feel comfortable with this arrangement.

In the district I live in, we have so many kids that the 8th graders and the freshmen go to a completely separate school than the rest of the high school, so my sophomore year was my first year of real high school. Because there are MANY more kids in the high school than in our other school, we didn't have many classes together.\r\n\r\nOne of my closest friends who we'll call Ashley (F16) was nervous about not having her classes with any of her friends. First semester was fine, but come second semester, she knew practically no one in her classes. Ashley was talking to me (M16) about how she didn't know what she was going to do about PE (you need friends in that class, trust me), and I was just telling her that she needs to put herself out there and try and meet new people. And so she did. She became quick friends with who we'll call Addison (F16). Eventually, Addison kinda becomes a part of our larger friend group. \r\n\r\nHere's where we run into some trouble. Addison and I have very different world views, because we have different perspectives. She's a young black girl and I'm a gay white guy. pretty different. She is extremely liberal, whereas I lean more conservative, and we have many differing opinions. I have zero problem being friends with someone that has a different opinion than me. But Addison likes to argue. It was fun at first, getting into little arguments, but it always leads to a heated debate where she gets REALLY emotional. Like, almost crying emotional. So that kind of got on my nerves.\r\n\r\nThe big thing though is this. I have this mental illness called OCD. My personal form of this is that I really like fives, I need to be even, I hate germs, and I like for things to be complete. Anyways, as Addison and I become better friends, I share this with her. She proceeds to be one of those assholes that's like \"oh? you obsess over germs? What happens if I touch the lid of your water bottle? ahaha\". usually, I try to not get too mad over this stuff. I just tell the person to not do that, they usually are like oh shit ok and we move on. But she will not listen. I can't even count how many times I've told her that I suffer from a real mental illness and that that she needs to stop, but she doesn't listen. Aggravating my OCD has caused problems for me outside of school too. It sucks. Even other friends of mind have tried to tell her, but she just does not get it. She tells me I just need to \"love myself\" and I'll be ok, but that's just so ignorant. \r\n\r\nAfter this shit, one day I snap. I tell her that I'm fucking over her shit and that I'm completely done with her. I also call her 'ignorant' and 'fake woke'. She cries. A lot of people in my group are mad at me. She texts me saying that what I did to her was \"not ok\". What the fuck. But it kinda made me think?

I was getting ready to move out when we found out about my mom\u2019s cancer, so now I\u2019m going to stay and help look after her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.  \r\n\r\n2) My mom is public about her illness, she\u2019s telling everyone. She was using Facebook to ask people to pray for her and they had lots of questions. I asked her if I should tell everyone what was going on, and she said yes, and read the post and thanked me. \r\n\r\n3) My sister didn\u2019t learn anything new about the illness on Facebook, she just saw it and disagreed with making it public, got upset with me for posting it, and when she found out my mom had consented, she was upset with my mom.\r\n\r\n4) I did not expect my sister would be upset until it was too late, and I am trying to see her point of view\r\n\r\n5) She has since forgiven my mom but not me\r\n\r\n6) Reasons for posting on Facebook: my mom\u2019s cancer is incurable and we are looking for hope. We want advice from people about how to choose between clinical studies and learn what to expect. My mom likes the love and support she gets and likes reading the comments. I often feel hopeless, and keeping people up to date makes me feel like I\u2019m *doing* something. My mom wants people to pray. \r\n\r\n7) I do not in any way want to fight with my sister and apologized to her. But I still feel responsible for her behavior towards my mom \r\n\r\n***8) I can accept the community\u2019s judgment here, but I am confused. I came here asking whether it was wrong of me to post on Facebook without checking in with my sister and whether her position is valid. Instead people are assuming I\u2019m actively fighting with my sister, which is not what happened, or going off saying I\u2019m not here for my mom\u2014who is very sick\u2014which is not true and is hurtful ***\r\n\r\n**thank you**\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nTo preface this, my sister (32F) and I (34M) do not have a close relationship. I find her intense\u2014one minute she\u2019s sweet and warm and the next she\u2019s laying in to you for something you said or describing another person with so much contempt it\u2019s uncomfortable for me. I deal with it by not having much of a relationship with her. It\u2019s obvious at gatherings with family/extended family that I am standoffish with her but not with other people. \r\n\r\nNow, to the present: two weeks ago we found out my mom has stage IV incurable pancreatic cancer. I\u2019ve been living with my parents temporarily due to an injury, so I will stay to help my mom. \r\n\r\nIt feels like we\u2019ve been dealing with this cancer forever\u2014setting appointments, getting people involved, getting ready for chemo etc. But my sister is three states away, where it\u2019s easier to slip into denial. She seems to think it might not really be that serious, and maybe like we\u2019re moving fast without her. \r\n\r\nTwo days ago, I made a Facebook post about the diagnosis. My sister saw it and texted me asking that we not air our family business publicly. She said she\u2019s being contacted by people asking uncomfortable questions and it\u2019s not appropriate. \r\n\r\nI said I\u2019m sorry this is all moving so fast and I understood that seeing it in writing was making it all seem very real. I offered to use filters to change the audience or run future posts by her. I think I was empathetic, but did not concede\u2014my mom enjoys the attention she gets from people online and frankly I think everyone in our distant family should know what\u2019s going on. \r\n\r\nMy sister said she was done with me and unfriended me on Facebook. Then called my mom to complain. \r\n\r\nMy mom said she was hurt by my sister\u2019s reaction and asked me to smooth it over. I said I had already apologized **edit: my mom was satisfied that I had apologized**. Then my mom started telling me how my sister still feels like I\u2019m favored because of the way we grew up and always felt like I got more attention and that\u2019s why she is so angry and lashes out at people. I said stop, it\u2019s hurtful feeling like I\u2019m responsible for my sister\u2019s issues when there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I had actually been ok with the situation until my mom said that. \r\n\r\nNow I feel like maybe I did disregard my sister\u2019s feelings, and obviously my sister is feeling very distant right now. Maybe I should have supported what she wants. \r\n\r\nTl/dr: My mom has pancreatic cancer and I announced it on Facebook, against the wishes of my sister, who is far away and feels left out."}, "1871": {"id": "dufuah", "title": "AITA for being disturbed by my (26F) bf's (33M) infinite list of past sexual partners?", "body": "Hi Reddit, this is my first post and also I'm not writing in my mother language, so I apologize in advance for that.\r\n\r\nA week ago my bf and I went out with two of his friends to have a drink.

At this point, I know that I shouldn't have done it, but I insisted to know the number of girls. He went silent, said that he didn't remember. I insisted and he said that it doesn't matter.

My step mother and my father are planning a baby shower for him (my unborn son) in January. My parents divorced when i was 19 and my relationship with my mother has always been strained but has been particularly bad the last few years. She constantly shit talks my father to my brothers (18 and 20 yo) and I, and is always bringing up the past. We understand she doesn\u2019t like him, that\u2019s why she divorced him, but her behavior makes it very hard for any of us to spend any significant quality time with her; to be clear we make it clear that this behavior is unacceptable and it has not curbed her habits in the least. \r\n\r\nThe last few months have been a lot better. She is incredibly excited about the baby, as is everyone in the family as it is my first child and their first grandchild/nephew. She has also offered a lot of help in respect to advice as well as providing for the baby itself. She bought me a bassinet, and has been buying essentials such as bottles and clothes, and recently bought a rather expensive stroller. We have been able to hang out and focus on the baby, aka the future, rather than crap in the past that is done and over with that every one else has moved on from. It was nice, until about a month ago when people really started pressuring me to have a baby shower. \r\nWell, my step mother wanted to plan one for me, so I said yes. I figured this meant I would have to do something separate with my moms side of the family, but here\u2019s where the problem is. My mother refuses to have a separate shower. \r\n\r\nShe is convinced that my dad just doesn\u2019t want her to be involved, and as soon as I proposed that maybe we do something separate it was as if all of the progress we made the last few months just evaporated, like it never happened. Anyway, I told my mom that I would ask about adding her to the guest list, which my father agreed to so long as she understands that THEY are hosting the shower, and she is strictly a guest, which I agreed to as that is in fact the case. Her response was a passive aggressive comment about some bs slight he has committed against her during her baby shower for my brother (who is 20). \r\nI just want to celebrate my sons life and generally enjoy my (by then) 9 months pregnant self.

I saw how parents stopped caring about the older one at all, and I didn't want this fate for myself as well.

I remember being extremely upset.\r\nThe worst part begun when we moved from Portugal to Russia. I had almost no social life, because I had to pick up my sister from the kindergarten after school and stay with her until my parents would come home (not earlier than 10 pm usually). Almost every single day, weekends included. \r\nWhen I graduated school and went to university, the second semester I started dating my current boyfriend. I'm happy with him, he's the most important person in my life, and I have no one closer. He has always been there for me and helped me to work through some of my issues (the way I feel about my body, for example). And then my relationship with my parents strained quite a bit. We were never really close and I've never really trusted them (specially after dad snooped all my social at 14 because someone told him I wrote slash fanfiction), but then it got way worse. My father would complain about me not helping them with my sister, about me cooking at my boyfriend's but not doing it home (taking into account that bf loves my food, and my parents always said it wasn't good, or that I took too long to cook, or even added stuff to a ready pot without asking me anything) and so on. \r\nNow dad loves saying that \"I don't do shit for my family, but I bust my ass for strangers\"... But I just reciprocate the treatment I get. \r\nI still don't love, or even like, my sister. She's a spoiled rude brat, who does whatever she wants with no consequences.

We didn\u2019t want that to happen. We also promised each other to not let our own romantic relationships get in the way of our friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had three boyfriends. I just got out of a relationship with my third one last month. My best friend got with his second girlfriend (19F) a little over a year ago. She just started out in this industry. Sure we hang out less often when one or both of us are in a relationship, but we haven\u2019t lost that magical chemistry. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy best friend\u2019s current girlfriend has never seemed to like me. She acts cold to me even though I treat her with kindness. I\u2019ve also only seen my best friend twice these past six months, ever since we finished filming a TV series together. I try to make plans for us to hang out together, and he almost always declines stating his busy schedule, but it\u2019s quite clear to me that his girlfriend is behind all of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis girlfriend found out about my recent breakup and has probably been more on edge than ever about me. My best friend and I had plans to hang out yesterday. However, I didn\u2019t know his girlfriend would also come.

I paid for flights and board and I buy our food but I don't pay her. We stay in the same apartment (2 bedroom) and have been for a month. So, I am incredibly good at making friends, the girl has a RBF and rolls her eyes (even though she doesn't realize she is). When we first came here, I made friends with some gentlemen and they would come over and we'd sit in the balcony, have some tea and great conversation. They hardly ever came in. Every time they tried to loop her in or invite her out to hang, she would rebuff them and roll her eyes and shut herself in her room.\r\n\r\nOn 2 consecutive nights, the friends came over, we talked and laughed and had tea and they left; once at approx 10pm. The next morning, girl is obviously pissed and didn't talk to me for 2 fucking days. Reason, I did not observe the agreed-upon 7.30pm curfew time for having new friends over and had them stay longer without asking. She was threatening to leave the project and fly back home. Apparently, she was so anxious all the time she couldn't sleep or eat, wondering when the guys would violate us sexually or steal our stuff. \"We are defenseless girls in a new place\"; she'd called her mum crying. I apologize and say it won't happen again. Peace returns.\r\n\r\nFirst forward to 2 days ago, she meets this guy- a foreigner - and on Tinder and guess what, first time they were actually meeting was in my balcony (small island, dude was staying at a hotel 2 seconds away). She'd invited him for a drink-off we'd planned earlier with my other friend. It was my suggestion to invite him over; some sort of double date. It was in the afternoon- well before the 7.30pm deadline. All of a sudden, all her anxiety is gone. She has spent the last 2 nights with him over. Apparently, I am also now allowed to have friends stay. We even got on a boat in a dark night to some floating bar while even going out for a social with my friends was a no-no \"I don't walk around at night with strange men\". Tinder dude is cool. Brings beer and is fun. Don't mind him at all.\r\n\r\nBut now, I'm beginning to feel resentful at the hypocrisy. My friends were met with aloofness and an eye-roll and I got a lecture. I engage with her friend to make him feel welcome; dude is leaving today back to his digital nomad ways. I'm still here with my friends for the next week until we're also gone.

I know the title sounds vague but I'll get into it.\r\n\r\nA bit of background first, I (19M) started university in September and moved into accommodation for students where I got 3 other random flatmates. 2 of which I get on with but 1, I'll call S, doesn't really speak to us much and spends most of his time in his room playing loud music. S makes no attempt to get to know the people he is living with. \r\n\r\nFast forward a few weeks, I finish uni and try and get some sleep as I have work in the morning to be woken up by loud banging and shouting at about 3am. I work early shifts so I was not impressed. In the morning, I go to make breakfast to see that S had brought some friends over while drunk and had stacked up all of the kitchen stuff they could into the corner of the room. Like they literally unplugged the microwave (something that is owned by the accommodation, so if it's broken the 4 of us will get a fine) and carefully balanced it on top of the pile. I was quite pissed off but quickly got ready for work and set off because I have early shifts. When I got home the mess was sorted out so I thought nothing of it. People do stupid stuff for a laugh when they're drunk I get it haha. What really annoyed me was what my flatmates found the next day. They also tried moving the fridge but failed to do so. However, they did unplug it and lots of food went bad.\r\n\r\nSkip to the Saturday just gone. I was working both Saturday and Sunday and S had friends over on both days. Saturday night I go in to see the entire room had been hotboxed (for those who don't know, that's when the doors and windows are shut and blocked so that the room is filled with smoke). They weren't just smoking tobacco by the smell either. Since they were all drinking too, I couldn't talk to them since they were so out of it, if you know what I mean. Sunday morning I go in the kitchen to see a similar sight. Sock still covering smoke alarm, beer bottles/cans all over the floor etc. There was rubbish all over the sides too since the bin was full. I changed the bag for the bin. I saw that S had left a lot of stuff laying around the kitchen such as phone chargers, extensions for cables and stuff like that. I just grabbed it and put it all in the trash. I knew talking to S would do nothing as I've tried in the past but he just replies with \"sure\". What made it worse was the fact that they had eaten some of our food that night too. Just straight up stolen from the fridge. There were kinda a few not so cheap things I threw away like the phone chargers but S clearly has no respect for us. I've thought about reporting him and I think I will soon.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering if this makes me a bad person. AITA for throwing away my flatmates ashtrays, drinks and wires?

I wasn't bullied too heavily but definitely made fun of quite a bit and looked down upon. For some reason girls would show more of a disgust/contempt to me.\r\n\r\nThere was one girl we call Pig. Pig wasn't a huge bully to me but she did make snide remarks to me and make fun of me, that I couldn't get any girls, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to university, I had bulked up a lot from the gym and cleared up my skin but became a bit of a douchebag from the ages of 18 to 21. I slept around and revelled in the attention but wouldn't return calls from girls etc. I since apologised to many of them, and went therapy to sort stuff.\r\n\r\nBut during this time, I found out that Pig went to my university. So I saw her in my second year when I was 19 and she greeted me, etc. Just basically acted like nothing happened and we were cool. Maybe she had matured but I was a bit pissed off then. I found out she was dating my friend Joe who was a big cheater/player. He was already considering cheating. When we were drunk I asked him whether he was having second thoughts and he said he was so I convinced him to cheat.\r\n\r\nPig found out he cheated and broke down and then confronted me tearfully and had some mental breakdown or something.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not proud of this. It was immature and wrong. \r\n\r\nSo fast forward to now. I was getting high with some friends yesterday and they asked me what's the most fucked up thing I ever did. I said the above.

I feel no remorse whatsoever.\" they looked at me a bit surprised but then forgot about it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I don't feel any remorse for what I did. I can't empathise with Pig whatsoever. I tried to do a meditation and feel empathy for her, but I felt nothing at all. I just cant feel any sympathy or empathy for her. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do feel sympathy and regret for some other people I treated badly. People.who didn't wrong me. I regret things I did to them.

As far as I know know he didn\u2019t sleep with anyone, he made plans to meet up with a girl but ended up backing out, and he was still sexually flirting with other girls and even bought one or two private snaps. What made me really upset was the fact I was sending him money at that time because he needed to send money to his family.

I admitted that it\u2019s been hard to trust him 100% since the incident and the fact he would let me see his phone at all last visit (which is understandable)and he got mad at me for not telling him earlier.

He said that he will be gone for 2 days.\r\n\r\nI was already in a bad mood because he woke me up at 3am and I couldn't get back to sleep so I was very upset and asked him to come home as I couldn't walk and needed to go to the bathroom badly.\r\n\r\nI have no family or friends who live anywhere near me so the only person who could help me out was my partner. He refused to come home as he doesn't see his family often and his cousins constantly complain about it and blame me, despite me telling him since we got together (just over a year ago) to put aside money to go see them every week which he says he will do but never does. \r\n\r\nHis cousins always complain about him not going to see them but they don't make the effort to come see him.\r\n\r\nThe rest of his family is fine with him spending most of his time here as we are engaged and we have been planning the wedding, being very supportive of it. But whenever he sees his cousins, we always end up having an argument because he's always breaking the promises he makes to me and he comes back in a bad mood.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wanted to discuss it face to face and sort it out as it was getting blown out of proportion. He was still refusing and when we were talking on the phone, his cousin seemed to be telling him what to say. Then he started messaging me saying that the relationship is toxic as we have the occasional argument, but what relationship doesn't? \"He\" was saying that I was being controlling for asking him not to stay overnight as I can't take the dog out and saying that he doesn't know if we should stay together.\r\n\r\nHis cousin ended up messaging me and taking his phone off him, telling me that he'd block me if I messaged my partner again. The last 10 or so messages didn't sound like my partner at all so I think that his cousins were putting ideas in his head until he broke up with me.\r\n\r\nI apologised and tried to sort it out.

I would bring it up to them and they\u2019d do nothing about it. \r\n\r\nOne time we were having a huge party and they were so lazy, that instead of doing all the dishes in the sink they threw them all in the spare room till the party was over. I was shocked. \r\n\r\nFlash foreword to early November. K and M are moving out together but they left a couple dishes in the sink. They messaged the group chat and said they were coming to get their dishes and that they better be clean. I told them I didn\u2019t dirty any of those dishes and I REFUSE to clean someone else\u2019s dishes. Then I told them to clean their garbage outside (they had a shit ton of litter just laying around that would fall from their bedroom window). \r\n\r\nK was so pissed that I didn\u2019t do any of THEIR dishes and she left one final warning. Something along the lines of \u201cmy dishes BETTER be clean tomorrow cause I\u2019m coming to get them\u201d. At THIS moment I walk outside and I still see her fucking empty bottles laying outside.

Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she\u2019d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. \r\n\r\nFast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we\u2019re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won\u2019t get into, but safe to say she\u2019s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. \r\n\r\nWell a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it\u2019s possibly important here to note that she doesn\u2019t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the \u2018popular\u2019 social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn\u2019t like to admit it, she was always jealous. \r\n\r\nI went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I\u2019m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of \u2018drunk again?\u2019 With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that\u2019s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.\r\n\r\nI mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I\u2019d brought home. She said she\u2019s glad she hurt me and asked if I\u2019ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, \u2018at least my daddy didn\u2019t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he\u2019d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.\u2019\r\n\r\nShe burst out crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and I haven\u2019t seen her since. My housemates, who already dislike her are on my side. My friends and family are also on my side for the most part. \r\nI knew her insecurities from our time together and said the most hurtful thing I could muster, specifically targeting what I knew would cause the most pain and distress and probably took it too far, so while I hate her, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m probably in the wrong, though remorse still eludes me. \r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA?"}, "1917": {"id": "e8vrvp", "title": "WIBTA if I didn't get my sister a Christmas gift?", "body": "My sister (18, F) just bought herself something expensive ( above 50$ ) and now says she 'can't afford' a Christmas gift for anybody.

Where I live they're pretty expensive ($5 a bag) so we don't eat them often. Our mother went to Australia about two weeks ago, where the same chips are sold for maybe $2 or $3 a bag, so when she came back last week she bought about twenty bags of chips back home for us to eat. I only eat the sea salt flavoured chips (they're my favourite flavour) so my mother got me five bags of that. I made it clear from the start that I would get all five of the sea salt bags and my brother could have whatever the hell he wanted of the other fifteen. \r\n\r\nCame home yesterday to find only four bags of my sea salt chips left. Asked around the house and it turns out my brother had a friend (15M) over and let his friend have a bag of my chips since he also liked that flavour and our mother allowed them to eat a bag. I was pretty pissed since I already specifically told him not to touch my chips and he had fifteen other bags of chips with three different assorted flavours to pick from, so in exchange I took a bag of lime and black pepper (which is his favourite) and ate that. Now he's pissed off at me, especially because that was the very last bag out of four bags (the other three of which were ALSO eaten by him anyway) and he has no more lime and black pepper chips while I still have four bags of sea salt chips. \r\n\r\nI know it was a bit petty and it's a really trivial matter, but seriously, considering I told him from the beginning to leave my chips alone and I also left his chips alone until he took one of mine, am I the asshole??\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks for the comments, everyone.

I should definitely have been a better adult/older sibling.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify some common threads I've seen in the comments - my mother did not specifically say my brother's friend could have that specific flavour of chips, she just allowed both of them to have a bag of chips at all (it was a point of contention because sometimes she buys snacks that are really pricey and she doesn't really want them being consumed by anyone except family, which my brother and I both recognise as fair). All the chips were kept in my room (which is accessible to all my family members), and my brother was the one responsible for going into my room and picking the bag. Also, I do like lime and black pepper chips. They're just not my favourite. I also want to make clear that I'm not making excuses for my actions! I recognise that I was the asshole and I was being really petty and childish. I appreciate the reality check. \r\n\r\nJust as a follow-up, I felt bad after sitting on the situation for a while, so I went out and got him a replacement bag of chips, and he apologised for taking mine too, so we\u2019re all good.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, everyone is also right - our mom is dope, and we are both really grateful for her bringing back all those chips from Australia!

The only exception is the present for his dad where we split the cost of buying wine and he organised it. This evening he brought up his dad's birthday casually. I asked when that was again and he said it was in three days. Three days. We will also be with his family in three days so we will actually be with his dad on his birthday. \r\n\r\nI then got a bit stroppy with him and asked him why he didn't mention it so I could plan ahead and get him a present etc. He said I had a reminder app on my phone and I should have used that. I said I always remind you about my family birthdays etc and help you organise and buy presents so why can't you do the same to me. I also pointed out that I feel like I do the majority of the emotional load regarding birthdays and Christmas (last year I bought the card and the present that he gave to his sister for her birthday because he didn't organise anything in time, I'd already organised my present and card for her earlier).\r\n\r\nNow he's really pissed off with me and is being all sulky.

I agreed to partaking in this family dinner as long as my Fiance's family could come as well, because it is his birthday afterall. He is the oldest of five.

The majority of my (30M) extended family to include cousins and grandparents all live in the same city about 2 hours away. The only real time I ever seen any of my extended family was during the holidays, or when my parents had to go on business trips at the same time and my grandma would babysit me and my older siblings. These are the only times I have visited my grandparents.\r\n\r\nMy immediate family is lower middle class and is poor in comparison to the rest of my family. All of my extended  family would take trips all around the world and never invited any of my immediate family.  On every trip my grandma would take rolls of pictures (before digital cameras) and would force me to look at the pictures when I visited. This was pretty much standard practice until my family moved to another state and saw them every other holiday. \r\n\r\nAlthough I saw even less of my extended family and grandparents, I still kept in fairly good contact with them. When I graduated HS I invited my grandparents, but they declined siting weather and mild health problems. I was disappointed but didnt really question it because I knew the ceremony would be held outside and it would HOT.\r\n\r\nFlashforward to four years later I was graduating from the university right down the road from my grandparents. They declined to see me walk siting large crowds and congested traffic on top of the old age and mild health problems. However, they were able to attend the college graduations of 2 of my cousins the years before and after I graduated. \r\n\r\nAbout a year later my extended family put together a book for my grandparents 60th anniversary.

He's gone before and both then and now we were voluntold to watch his little terrier dog while he was gone.

He used to have another dog who passed away just before we first dogsat. His little dog is not well cared for.

We're looking to get our own house this year and managing all of this, perhaps renting (renting with three dogs, let alone one being incontinent and another being a \"danger\" breed can be hard enough), and we would want a puppy once the older dog passes, but nothing planned right now.\r\n\r\nBottom line, an unexpected 4th dog doesn't fit into our future like we anticipate.

My reasoning was that, since the game is already complicated, simplifying the rules as best we can is the optimal strategy for new, inexperienced players. Additionally, having players roll for stats is risky and randomized, and could result in one person getting incredible scores and another getting crappy scores. Taking the defaults makes everything fair and balanced.\r\n\r\nI told her all this and, despite my calm explanation, she kept insisting---to the point where I said \"Are you really gonna be like this right now?\" and basically put my foot down as DM (dungeon master), stating that this is the way we're going to do things.

Xmas eve is very loud, along with 30+ people in a VERY tight space. We knew our daughter wasn\u2019t going to make it long or late there because of the time of night and the loud, tight space. After her first tiny meltdown (her obvious signal she\u2019s ready for bed), we started to get ready to go. We had only spent about 2 hours at the party. We didn\u2019t even make it for dessert. Xmas eve with my side goes until 11:30/12 at night, so we left VERY early. When I was saying goodbye to my dad, I could tell he was disappointed and upset we were leaving. It breaks my heart to see my dad that way. As soon as we got to the car, I completely lost it. I just sobbed. My husband asked me what was wrong and I said I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it. I knew if I tried, I would cry harder and wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it calmly. We drove home in silence and I thought he was giving me the space I asked for. \r\n\r\nWhen we got home he snapped at me and said. \u201cAre you going to tell me or what?\u201d. His tone was not warm or understanding. I could tell he was angry. I said, \u201cnot yet\u201d, thinking in my head I\u2019d rather spill when our daughter was sleeping. \r\n\r\nWe give her a bath and I was pretty ready to talk about it, but I could tell he was fuming that I hadn\u2019t yet and didn\u2019t want him to snap at me in front of her. \r\n\r\nAfter she was put to bed, he asked me again, very harshly to tell him what was the matter. I told him his lack of warm ness and tone was making it harder for me to talk and open up about it. He said I was being \u201cselfish\u201d and that \u201cI ruined a great night.\u201d I said I felt it was fair that I asked for some time before talking about it. He strongly disagreed. He said that he is \u201cmy husband\u201d and I was \u201cbeing ridiculous\u201d as I could have told him quickly already. He repeated at least three times during his rant that I \u201cruined Xmas\u201d. Now that he\u2019s angry with me I don\u2019t feel comfortable sitting him and telling him what was wrong. I feel like he will just criticize me for not saying it sooner. So right now we aren\u2019t speaking. So reddit, AITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: After the first few comments I was able to see the other side of things. I talked to my husband. I apologized for leaving him in the dark.

We see them regularly. Christmas Eve is with all of his 4 brothers and family (30+) people. I wasn\u2019t upset for leaving my dad. I felt bad that he was disappointed we weren\u2019t staying for our one time of year holiday with his side. My dad is a big family person and I don\u2019t see shame in that. \r\n\r\n2. No, I am not using the pregnancy card to defend my lack of communication. I am using it to explain why I cried like an idiot. I\u2019m well aware my emotions got out of control. \r\n\r\n3.

My boyfriend (29) is flying out to stay for the remainder of the holiday on the 27th. For New Years my family has a tradition of going to a nice restaurant for a prix fixe dinner celebration, the price is about $130 per person. Originally, my mom said that she would buy both of our tickets, but she called back a few days later saying upon further thought, she wasn\u2019t comfortable spending so much on a ticket for a non family member and asked that I buy the ticket for him as a gift. I told her that I understood, but privately I was hurt that she was putting up this barrier up that she didn\u2019t feel that he was part of the family (I get that he\u2019s not, but it hurt that she was so explicit about it). I bought his ticket but never had any discussion with him about who purchased it. I didn\u2019t want to say this was his gift, because I wanted to give him something meaningful/sentimental and the dinner was more of an obligation while he\u2019s visiting. \r\n\r\nShortly after this, my mom calls me and tells me when he\u2019s visiting, he will have to sleep on the couch since we aren\u2019t married. I found this ridiculous because we live together and my parents have stayed with us and didn\u2019t have a problem. I did tell my mom this, but she said it\u2019s her house, her rules. While this was a few months ago, I didn\u2019t tell my boyfriend because I thought I could get through to them. \r\n\r\nUltimately, I don\u2019t think either of us care if we sleep in the same bed together, but I worry about what message this will send to him. I\u2019m embarrassed that he\u2019s being kept at arms length by my family and I don\u2019t want him to feel unwelcome. If the situation was reversed I would feel awkward and unwelcome.

For a majority of our relationship, he was depressed. I ended up having to take care of him for the last few months before he ended things. I cooked for him, drove him places (i.e. doctors and school), reminded him to take his medication, and basically skipped events in my life (class, study groups, etc.) to take care of and/or check on him. Whenever he would text me saying he needed me, I was there. And he always told me he would make it up to me. Unfortunately, he failed a lot of his classes, and would not be returning to school next semester.\r\n\r\nRecently, he went home for Christmas break, and out of the blue broke up with me in an email. He used to tell me how manipulative/controlling his parents were, and I can only assume they were part of the decision process. However, his parents don't know everything I did to help him, as he never told them.\r\n\r\nConsidering what I did for him, the manner in which he broke up with me made me feel like I got slapped in the face. I emailed him my feelings over the breakup (that I was heartbroken but I respected his decision). He then responded that he had a \"hard time accepting this life without me\" and that he didn't know if he made the right decision. This also led me to believe it wasn't his decision, but his parents'.\r\n\r\nI'll admit I was harsh in my response. However, I was hurt too and felt him saying that was unnecessary and only prolonged my pain. I also felt he was trying to make me feel bad for him which was completely unfair. I responded something along the lines of \"you did make the wrong decision because breaking up with someone should lead to happiness or relief\" and that \"you're not allowed to have a hard time accepting this, because it was your decision not mine\".\r\n\r\nHe later told me he was returning to school next semester after all, to which I said that would make it harder for me to go back. (out of sadness from possibly seeing him)\r\n\r\nIn that conversation, he basically said 4 things to me:\r\n\r\n1. I was selfish\r\n2. I never cared about his success\r\n3. Him and his mom (!!! what !!!) thought I was being insensitive with my last email\r\n4. It's my fault that his parents don't know what I did for him - because I was \"too shy\" and never got to know them\r\n\r\nFor #4, yes, I am shy. However, I went to every family event with him that he invited me to (<10 occasions), and I did make conversation with his parents. I never told his parents what I did for him because I felt it wasn't my place. I felt he had to communicate sensitive information with them as they are his parents, not mine, and we only dated for a short period.\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole here?"}, "1942": {"id": "efs3kr", "title": "AITA for not wanting my brother to inherit a priceless family heirloom after our other brothers death?", "body": "Recently, my (41,F) younger brother Jensen (35) died. He was the baby of the family and we were very close. He was also extremely close to my son, 19, (Conner). Jensen never had kids of his own and was like a father figure to my son, whose own father was not in the picture.\r\n\r\nWe have another brother, Jake (38). Jake and Jensen had a very contentious, fractured relationship. A lot of this was due to drugs, but even when they were young Jake dominated him. Anything Jensen had, Jake took. He would even open his Christmas presents, and try to play with them before Jensen could. This kind of behavior continued into their adulthood and they rarely got along.\r\n\r\nMy father is a Vietnam Vet and had a necklace he found in the jungles. He wore it as a talisman for years but eventually gave it to Jensen. Jensen never took it off. At some point, Jake stole it from him and so Jensen stole it back. After that he never took it off. In fact, he died wearing it.\r\n\r\nBut a few years before he died, he talked to me. He told me that if anything ever happened to him, he wanted Connor to have the necklace. He said since Connor was like a son to him, that it should be his. He made me swear that I'd see to this and that Jake should not get his hands on it. He was adamant about it. He said Jake had always taken everything he had, and that it was important to him that he not get this. I think he knew his death was imminent somehow which is why he made me promise. And so I swore I would.\r\n\r\nWhen Jensen died, I told my parents about our chat and my dad said he wanted to hold the necklace for a year or so and give it to Conner when he left for college. I said okay. Unfortunately, Jake got wind of this and threw a fit. He said the necklace was rightfully his because Jenson stole it from him in the first place (he did not.) Conner doesn't want to upset the family or cause drama so he told Jake he could \"hold onto the necklace for a while.\"\r\n\r\nI'm pissed and got into an argument with my son about this. When I told him that Jensen wanted him to have the necklace I warned him that Jake would be mad and try to take it. He said he would not let that happen. But he did. And now I feel like I've broken the oath I made to my brother. In my mind, my brother is still dominating our baby brother even in death.\r\n\r\nMy son says it's none of my business and to stay out of it. I feel it is my business because Jensen made it my business by putting me in charge of making sure his wishes are being carried out. I want to talk to my father, get the necklace, and make sure it's given to my son and not Jake. But Conner says I'm not \"allowed\" to talk to anyone about this. I told him I can talk to whomever I please. In case it's not clear, he really does want the necklace his uncle left him, but he's apparently more worried about not pissing off his other uncle. He's very afraid of rocking the boat with him.\r\n\r\nI just want him to inherit the necklace that his uncle wanted him to have.\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nEdit: fixed spelling of names.

We invited friends FF(45) and MF (48) and their DS(14) and DS(19).  We have twins DS(10) &amp;amp; DD(10) and DS(4). And 3 cats. We\u2019ve known them for years. The cabin is split in two living sections with a door between. \r\n\r\nFirst night was ok but FF seemed a bit grumpy.  The next day she barely spoke to us except for to say how loud and chaotic our side was (ha ha joke joke) and how she slept so badly. Night 2 &amp;amp; 3 still complaining re sleep.\r\n\r\nChristmas morning we open gifts separately. We got our kids nice gifts but nothing crazy. They came in after gifts. FF looked around and said, wow you kids are spoiled.  Note: a month ago DD came home in tears when a kid called her spoiled so I knew this would be hurtful to her especially.\r\n\r\nI looked up and said (maybe snapped?), \u201cnot spoiled.\u201d.\r\nFF yelled, \u201cwhy do you always correct me? \u201c. (I don\u2019t recall ever correcting her!)  I replied, \u201cno I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s just that DD had an issue about this at school and plus they aren\u2019t spoiled.\u201d FF repeated, \u201cwell I can say what I want and they are spoiled! Spoiled and lucky!\u201d And stomped out. \r\n\r\nDS(10) came to me and asked what spoiled meant and i said it means rotten, like when a fruit or egg spoils, or when a kid gets too much stuff or their parents give them too much. I said, I think maybe she doesn\u2019t know what it means. Suddenly she storms in (eavesdropping) and screamed,\u201d you\u2019re an effing liar!!  You told him I said he was rotten!\u201d I told her he asked the meaning and I showed him the dictionary definitions on my phone. Edit: I did say both definitions but she only overheard the word \u201crotten\u201d and extrapolated the rest. I edited this paragraph to reflect that. \r\n\r\nI went away from the kids outside and asked her to talk. She said she meant the kids were lucky and spoiled means lucky.  I said, do you know the definition of spoiled?  She didn\u2019t answer so I repeated (later DH said this came across aggressive). Then I said this is obviously a misunderstanding and I\u2019m sorry, next time I will talk to you in private. She lost her temper saying I embarrassed her and said I was basically a bully. I apologized again and said that if I ever do anything please tell me so I can fix it.  She couldn\u2019t come up with any examples. Everything I said made her more and more mad. It came up that her sleep issue was because we were too loud.  I said next time tell us the first day and we can figure it out.  She said she did say so.  (Complaining about noise and sleep apparently meant it was us.)  I said sorry again and please just tell me things directly as I\u2019m not good at reading between the lines.  We were really quiet the next two nights after this.  I actually didn\u2019t know until then they could hear us - they are super quiet. \r\n\r\nThe following two days she seemed somewhat better but grumpy.  I asked if I could give her a hug and she said maybe tomorrow. They left this morning 5 days early with no explanation. \r\n\r\nAfter discussing with DH I think I should have walked away and given her time and not pushed to resolve the conflict, but he and I don\u2019t think it was wrong to say, \u201cnot spoiled\u201d except maybe do it in private next time.

The friend in question I had been good childhood friends with, we met when we were both 7 and had stayed friends for years and only drifted away when we were about 15. A few months before I met my girlfriend, my friend messaged me and we talked for a while before she finally asked me what she was wondering. Her and her boyfriend(20) wanted to have a three-some, and she wanted to know if I would be their third. I told her no, nicely, and it was no big deal. It didn\u2019t bother me, and she didn\u2019t seem uncomfortable talking to me after so I let it go. We didn\u2019t talk for a while after that, I met my girlfriend and started dating her and it\u2019s going very well.\r\n\r\nWell, a few nights ago my friend hit me up again, not asking for any sexual favors this time, just chatting with me as friends. My girlfriend saw the messages and made a comment of something like \u201coh, I didn\u2019t know you were friends with her\u201d and I asked her if it bothered her and she goes \u201ca little, but it\u2019s not my place. I feel bad, but I\u2019ve heard some rumors about her, so I have a bad feeling towards her\u201d she didn\u2019t tell me I couldn\u2019t be friends with her and it seemed fine. I didn\u2019t tell her about my friend asking me to be in a threesome to her, as I figured it would have caused more problems than it would have done good. But, my girlfriend apparently was not okay with me being friends with her, as my friend texted me this morning and my girlfriend saw it before me. It was just a harmless \u201cgood morning\u201d, but my girlfriend read back through our messages. Boy, was she not happy.\r\n\r\nI feel like she\u2019s the asshole for breaking my trust and reading my messages, but I also feel like I\u2019m the asshole for not telling her. I also feel like she\u2019s over reacting since I very explicitly told my friend that I wasn\u2019t interested in doing anything sexual with her, but I can see where she\u2019d still be uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSo, who\u2019s TA here? and if it\u2019s me, what should I do about it?\r\n\r\nEdit: since there\u2019s a lot of speculation about what was said I\u2019ll just explain that too. So the first time we talked she was asking me what I had been doing since school ended (We graduated last year) and I told her that I had just been working. She asked how my family was doing and I did the same and it was all pretty basic stuff. Finally she says \u201ccan I ask you something? Don\u2019t be weird about it?\u201d And I said okay and she said \u201cme and (BF) have been talking about having a threesome, and I suggested you be our third\u201d all I said was wow and she goes \u201cI told you don\u2019t be weird\u201d and I told her \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable doing that with the two of you. I\u2019m sorry\u201d and she said it was no big deal, she just wanted to see what I would say and then we said goodnight. If it\u2019s important, this all started at 7:30pm. The next time she messaged me a few days ago she messaged me good morning at 5 am and I responded a few hours later. She responded again around noon asking me what I was up to, I told her I was going to my girlfriends house in a bit, and she just told me she was working. She didn\u2019t message me again until about 4 pm when I was at my girlfriends house. We were just watching tv, so I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal to respond. My girlfriend asked me who I was texting, and then the conversation above ensued and it was over. I texted her now and then until we went to bed around 9.

They do not have a relationship.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a very unstable guy that causes a lot of drama through running away and hiding under a bridge whenever he\u2019s in an argument or whenever Lewis tells him he needs to find a place to live, calling me names like \u201cwannabe rich bitch\u201d when I wear a smart coat, tells lies like \u201cI had a coat like that once. It was sabre tooth fur\u201d. He took a lot of Lewis\u2019 pain medication (for severe back problems) as a response to a fight he had with Lewis, sucks someone off at an event he and Lewis attended (giving Lewis a bad name while doing so). I can go on forever. The point I\u2019m making is: I really really dislike this guy passionately.\r\n\r\nSo then in August I started dating my boyfriend (24M lets call him Adam) and turns out he knows Gary. He tells me he constantly gets sexual texts from him, asking Adam when they\u2019re going to f*ck, that he\u2019s handsome, asking sexual questions etc. I was okay with not saying anything about that.

It's been a very hard month for everyone involved, especially my bf, H, who was very close to his brother.\r\n\r\nShortly after the diagnoses, the brother started living with his parents. His mom has wanted a dog for ages and brother needed a reason to get out of bed, so H encouraged them to get one as a support animal + keep his mom company after his passing. My bf and I agreed to take the dog in the future as a last resort if his mom wanted to give it up to a shelter. We made this agreement on the basis they were adopting a senior dog.\r\n\r\nInstead, they got a rambunctious, 8wk puppy from from Kijiji. It's everything we don't want in a dog - small, medium hair, female, high energy. We were furious. This was not the agreement. We retracted our offer to take the dog.\r\n\r\nFast forward close to brother's death. Mom has realised a puppy is a lot of work and doesn't want it anymore. Dog is roughly 14mo at this point. She asks us, \"so you're going to take it, right?\" We say no. We have been looking at getting our own dog and feel no bond or desire for the one she bought.\r\n\r\nThen the brother died. In the days before his death, he begged the family to take care of his dog. Mom still doesn't want the dog, so now it's on our shoulders to take it in. H, who previously said he didn't want the dog, now feels honour bound to take it. He also wants his brother back, and the dog is the closest thing he has - but doesn't actually want the dog. It's an emotional mess.\r\n\r\nBecause H said he will take the dog now, the only thing holding us back from actually adopting her is me. I feel an immense amount of pressure and honestly, anger. The thing with this dog, everyone knows it to be brother's dog. It's will never be \"our\" dog. Then there's the shallow side - I think she's ugly. Our situation also has me, not H, looking after the dog 80% of the time. \r\n\r\nThis is serious enough in my mind that I question our 3 year relationship and talks of getting engaged. Neither of us want children, but we do want a dog. We can only handle/house one dog at this time.\r\n\r\nWIBTA if I said no to taking in and raising a dog for the next 10 to 15 years, when she has a large emotional worth to his side of the family?

It's like everyone thinks every dog is a precious little angel and you've never thought a certain breed was funky looking. She is an Aussie/terrier mix, since someone requested I put the breed in the main post. \r\n\r\nYou also gloss over that NEITHER of us wanted the dog from the start and we stayed fairly vocal about that throughout. That opinion didn't change until brother begged his family to take care of dog and H knew his mom wasn't happy with her; brother was kept very unaware of the fact his mother didn't want to keep the dog. He died assuming she would keep it and was excited for his dog to play with the dog we got in the future. \r\n\r\nFor those who gave genuine advice, both good and bad, thank you.

We had no intentions of doing anything to them so we proceeded to go to the field where we found some sticks and were sword fighting with them and such. Though on our way to get the sticks my two friends started yelling \"Heil Hitler\" and making the Nazi gesture with their hands. I had told them earlier to stop yelling these things as they were in MY neighborhood and I didn't want anyone thinking I was a Nazi or some crazy shit like that. Fast forward 40 minutes of just horsing around with the sticks we decided to leave the field. So we left through a gap in the fence and one of my friends was stuck trying to get through the fence and to the other side. Jokingly, me and my other friend decided it would be funny if we fake ditched him, so me and my friend had ran quite a distance away from him but then he comes back to us and says that the two kids building the igloo had told us to knock it off on the heil Hitler thing because they said they were Jewish. I gave my friends a \"thanks alot\" look and we proceeded to walk away, although my friends thought it would be really funny to do it AGAIN after knowing that they were Jewish. Next thing we're walking away from the school, the kids take a picture of us, the parent posted it on Facebook, I get punished because my parents see the Facebook post and asked to see pictures of these kids, and now I'm paranoid to go outside because people may think I'm something I am not.

I am 20F, and i currently work and provide for my mother who has difficulty with movement and frequent pains in her hips and bones. People living in the house include my younger sister (15 yrs old), my older sister (27 yrs old and also working) and her 3 children (2 yr M, 4 yr M, 8yr F). My mother baby sits the three children while my older sister and I are at work. I go to work at around 8AM and get home by at least 4pm mon-fri. When i get home, the house is usually a WRECK, and i sometimes find my mom trying to clean whilst watching all three of my sisters children. Meanwhile my younger sister is on her phone on the third floor of the house doing absolutely nothing. Don't get me wrong, my mother is a proud grandmother and offered to watch my sisters children, so it's not as though the task is forced on her. Even turning down a baby sitter which was offered numerous times. One day after a very long and frustrating day of work I get home to the house as usual a total mess from the children and as my older sister doesn't get home until later, its just my mother and the children home atm. My mom asked me to do the dishes and something in me just.. Snapped. The conversation goes as follows \r\n\r\nMom: Honey can you do the dishes? I've been a little busy today. \r\n\r\nMe: where the heck is younger sibling? \r\n\r\nMom: oh she asked to go to a friends house so i just let her go to get her out of my hair \r\n\r\nMe:...you do realize its her day to do the dishes today, yeah? \r\n\r\nMom: I just needed some quiet time. Why cant you just do it?\r\n\r\nMe: mom im 20 yrs old and i dont get to even have personal time until ALL my chores are done. And these aren't my chores. So no.. I wont do them. \r\n\r\nFrom there i called younger sibling and had her come all the way back home to do them, and as it was now 9PM it was too late to go back out. She says im the A-hole and my mom said it was petty. So I just wanna know.. AITA? \r\n\r\nJust wanted to address a few things instead of answering to every comment (which i appreciated no matter how rude) \r\n\r\n1. Yes there was a handful of better ways I could have handled this situation, and I now realize that. Tomorrow morning I will be apologizing and discussing some house rules to help at least maintain things while my sister and I are working. I admit i shouldn't have let work place frustrations harm my relationships at home. \r\n\r\n2. A lot of people are kinda blaming my older sister for \"dumping the kids\" on my mother. We've had countless discussions and even going behind my mothers back to get the children a babysitter (which we found quite a few well qualified ones) but mom heavily protests against it. Not sure why, but i am the child she is the parent and I nor my older sister can change the things she wants unfortunately.  \r\n\r\n3. Having the dishes as a chore one day out of the week shouldn't be a problem for a 15 year old. At that age for both my sister and i we had an entire week of chores that included dishes, laundry, and yard work. And we HATED IT. so to give her a sense of responsibility, she has ONE day out of the week. That way she has time to leave the house and get her own personal time (she's a teen. She DEFIANTLY needs it.)  \r\n \r\n\r\nI will be updating the outcome of our conversations tomorrow, and thank you once again for all of you guys insight on the situation. It means a lot to me. \r\n\r\nUpdate! I'm on my hour lunch at work so im gonna try and make this quick. We had a nice long discussion this morning. The discussions consisted of how everyone was feeling and what we can switch around to make a healthy change for everyone. I proceeded with giving out an apology to both my little sister and mother, as there was a better way to handle things and i shouldn't have gotten so frustrated. I vented on how I feel mom can be a bit more stern, which was agreed upon and we know have house rules updated. \r\n1. Before you leave finish chores and homework\r\n2. Leave all outside stress, OUTSIDE. \r\n3.

He could tell that we had gone out before the class, and even admitted that he thought it was funny. After class ended, my boyfriend pulled me aside and told me he was upset with me and I embarrassed him and was not to do something like that. I told him that me going to happy hour before class didn't affect him, and I had that I had every right to do what I wanted.

The past 3 years I didn\u2019t mind, but he visited with more frequency this year and I really wanted to my last football season as a student.

Tim is currently living at home while he works and goes to community college. Mark is married, lives with his wife about 15-20 minutes away, works and is taking online classes to be an engineer.

She already owed my mom money for rent, but we loaned her an additional 13.000 DKK (approx. 1.300\u20ac) so she could go to a festival with her friends, eating out, and for her going out clubbing so she would properly enjoy her graduation. We also paid for other stuff like rent and food, which she paid for herself after moving back in with my mom. My mom paid for most of this since I'm a student. \r\n\r\nMy mom didn't want to loan her the money but I felt bad that my sister felt left out and made a deal with my mom. We would offer my sister different \"loan plans\" e.g. one where we only pay for the necessities till she got a job with 0% interest rate, or where we would pay for all the fun stuff with 20% interest rate. She would pay us back when she got a full time job after graduation, where we would help her manage her money. She chose no. 2.\r\n\r\nProblem is, she didn't get a job for a few months, and when she did, it was as a substitute in a kindergarden. After working there a month she was certain she would get full time soon and decided to move out, since my mom and sister didn't get along. Aaand then she didn't get more hours. We didn't have any more money to loan her, since we literally gave her all our saving (my mom knew she would be fired soon for being gone so long, and wanted to have some money for food and therapy). Mid november my sister got a loan on her creditcard. She finally got another substitute job in December, and has been working fulltime since.\r\n\r\nOkay here is where I need your judgement. Instead of paying us and the bank back, she wants to buy tickets for the same festival again. Well, not instead of, but she wants to do that first, since the tickets might be sold out. She thinks it's unfair that we want all her disposable income, and that she should be able to enjoy her hard earned money. My mom and I also bought a trip to Rome (200\u20ac pr person for hotel and flight) for late April, which my sister think is unfair, and that we should've invited her to go with, since she hasn't traveled for a while. She also think it's weird we can afford it, and we said that we expect her to at least pay the 200\u20ac by that time. She says that we are being controlling and unfair, and putting a lot of pressure on her being able to pay the money back quickly. She also has ADHD, depression and anxiety. She hasn't mentioned this, but maybe I should be more understanding bc of this? I told her that if I find out she has bought the festival tickets before paying us back for last year's festival, I'll not talk to her anymore. We've then told her that if her hours continue to be the same, we expect her to pay us back by the end of April the latest.\r\n\r\nSo, IATA for pressuring my sister to pay us back before April, not leaving her money to do much else besides food and bills?"}, "1992": {"id": "eq7rl3", "title": "AITA for asking my mom to apologize for her controlling behavior?", "body": "My husband (31m) and I (30f) got married a year ago and my mother and I still aren\u2019t speaking.

My ideal wedding would have been at a courthouse but both of our families made their desires for something more formal known. My mother agreed to have it at her house and seemed happy about it. She has had many family gatherings at her house and it can easily accommodate both my husband\u2019s and my immediate family. \r\n\r\nIn planning it with my mother, I was clear about my desire for something simple (e.g. no flowers, no decorations, no wedding planner, no dj etc.). Just family, food, and a marriage license. Not only was it our day, but I felt like I was already compromising significantly by having any kind of event and I expected her to meet me in the middle. We divided the planning tasks and she offered to deal with the catering. After repeatedly expressing my desires for a simple, minimal affair, both by phone and (unanswered) email, she hired a wedding planner and proceeded to make the rest of her plans without telling us about them. \r\n\r\nAfter finding out about her wedding planner and plans to hire other staff on the day, among other things, I asked her to stop.

I said it was all fine, we totally understood and hadn\u2019t been upset at all, and I just hoped she realised we were teasing.

I felt this was a major overreaction, so maybe they were winding me up. I said it sounded like they were playing a game or something, and to have a good night (yes, I realise I messed this part up badly).

Another girl my friend was with asks me if I wanted to join them and I say no bc I'm pissed at this point. Now my best friend says nothing about blowing me off for the second friday in a row and I can't seem to not be bitchy towards her at this point, since she has done similar shit like this multiple turns before. \r\n\r\nSo I was upset got ice cream with my boyfriend and I end up complaining about my best friend.

We were best friends for a couple of years before eventually dating and getting married. In that span of time he had some girlfriends here and there, nothing too serious with any of them. I would meet them and everything, and would often become friends with them before he would break it off.\r\n\r\nI never really put any pieces together until we went out drinking with a few mutual friends the other night, most of whom he's known since high school, and I only met when we were in college together. We were all sitting around joking about the stupid things everyone had did in high school, when suddenly one of our closest friends says \"Yeah, your husband over there has always been into big girls.\"\r\n\r\nLet me say right quick, calling me big or fat isn't a crazy thing in my friend group. I'm not insanely obese but I am pretty overweight. I do it a ton simply because it doesn't bother me, and this friend is particularly close to the both of us, so he has a sort of special permission to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, the conversation continued, and I didn't think much of it until I realized that every single one of my husband's 7 exes had been overweight to at least some degree. They really had no other common characteristics, or interests.\r\n\r\nI should also point out that my husband is very *very* fit, and although I've tried to lose some weight he always tells me I don't need to. It never really occurred to me until recently, but every time I try to go on his diets with him, or even go for a run with him, he pretty much tells me not to, or takes me out for a big fancy dinner later in the week.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing began to weigh on me for a couple of days until finally I went to my husband and asked if he was only into fat girls, and if he was trying to keep me fat. He lost it on me, and accused me of thinking the worst about him just because he likes girls regardless of weight. He even called me fatphobic or something like that at one point. We move on pretty quick from our arguments, but it's been a little tense in the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe next day I called my best friend who told me I was being an asshole, and to apologize, since it doesn't really matter, because he loves me.

My one confidant said I'm the asshole since he loves me. AITA?\r\n\r\nEdit/Update: Unsurprisingly, my husband managed to find this...because a friend of his (not mutual) sent it to him. I started apologizing for accusing him of trying to keep me fat...when he full on had a breakdown. My husband is usually emotional and sensitive but this was way over the top. I asked him what was wrong, and he said that he had always only been into bigger girls, and that he worried that if I lost weight, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. He said he loves me, but if I lost weight, our sex life would probably die and he would need a divorce.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this really through me off. I love my husband, with my whole heart, but I don't know how I feel about my weight being the only thing keeping him attracted to me. It's a lot to figure out. Even though I've stayed in the house and haven't left, things aren't any less tense.\r\n\r\nLast update from 2/1: Maybe you came back to this post looking for your own comment, and noticed the edits. Either way, I don't really care and don't really think anybody will notice, but for those of you who want closure, here we go.\r\n\r\nSo yes, it turns out my husband has a fat fetish. In fact, one person joked that I should look at his porn habits...haha. Didn't have to look, he showed me. Our bank account has had many porn site transactions going through that I never really cared or noticed, all of which go to premium accounts of fat girl porn. My husband likes what he likes I suppose. \r\n\r\nAfter many days of talking, I realized that my husband loves me too much to really 'try' and keep me fat. He said that's what he was doing, but honestly, he's a little too stupid to really do anything bad. I love him, but he's a dumbass. So if he wants what he wants, he can have it, but he's not allowed to 'subtly' try and keep me from losing weight. In fact, he's helping me and being truly supportive. Although I didn't mention it before, because I didn't think it was necessary, my husband's hobby is personal training, and he does it about 3 hours a day, plus his own gym time. He's helping me now, and I've lost about 8 pounds. He said he loves me too much to let a stupid fetish get in the way of our relationship or our sex life.

My husband (28F) and I (28F) got married about six months ago. My friend (27F), Sara, attended the wedding with her fiance (27M). I've known Sara for about 9 years now. We were roommates in college for about three years. After we graduated college, Sara and I went to live in different cities. As expected, we drifted apart some but we always connected via text every few months. She also visited me twice with our mutual friends. So, when my engagement happened and we started to plan our wedding, there was no question that I would invite Sara, as well as a few other mutual friends we shared from college.\r\n\r\nAbout a year leading up to my wedding, Sara and I didn't talk too much but honestly, I was so busy planning my wedding while working a full time job and finishing school, that it was hard for me to keep in touch with any of my friends. When we did text, however, it felt like old times. When the invites went out for my bridal shower, I did not receive a word from Sara about whether or not she was coming and she didn't end up coming. No problem, I figured, it was about 90 minutes from her location, no big deal, and I brushed it off. Besides, she had RSVP'ed to the wedding, which was of course more important to me.\r\n\r\nThe wedding day comes. During the ceremony, I'm sitting up front with my soon-to-be husband during our church service. I see Sara and I's mutual friends but no Sara. No problem, a bit annoyed, but I enjoyed the rest of the day and figured I would see her at the reception. She arrived at the reception and everything seemed great! We talked and laughed together, took some pictures. It was a great wedding day.\r\n\r\nWhile opening our wedding gifts and filling out thank you cards after the wedding, I notice there's no gift from Sara. Not even a card. I know she traveled a bit for our wedding so I would have been so happy with a hand-written card! But nothing. I was more sad than angry. In hindsight, I should have confronted her but I never did, which makes me think I'm in the wrong here as well.\r\n\r\nNow, I received a text from Sara. We talk a bit and she confirms my address with me. A few days later,I receive an invite to her wedding. I'm so happy for her and immediately RSVP yes! But here's where my question comes in: WIBTA if I didn't give her a gift? I feel like I would be acting petty if I didn't give her one but I'm honestly still salty when I think about my own wedding.

My other brother (14M) then told her \"You do know, you were responsible for moving his clothes this morning\" or something like that.\r\nShe said \"Yes, it's in the suitcase in the backroom\" and gave me a little playful smirk, as if she enjoyed me wasting 25 minutes of my life looking for **one pair of trousers**. \r\n\r\nI was mad. \"Why didn't you tell me earlier??\" She said she didn't know before, which is obviously a stupid excuse. I told her she knows very well how things get moved around the house a lot, the kid was getting cold and how she wasted my time. She just repeated I didn't know and told me to stop shouting but I genuinely didn't care of what she had to say, called her a \"dumb idiot\" and went to get his trousers.\r\n\r\nSure and surprisingly enough, his trousers were there. I put it on for him and left to do my own business.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I lost my mind, but it seriously isn't cool when you pull off pranks like that.

I told her if she woke me up any later that i wouldn't do it because she wanted a sock bun and that takes forever to make it look good, especially with how much hair she has. \r\n\r\nAnyway, she woke me up at 7:40, i told her just to pull her hair back and get ready for school because there wasn't the time, and i went back to sleep for a few minutes because i don't need to drive her until 8:05. (I get that going back to sleep might have been a bad move on my part, but all i had to do was get up and get in the car)\r\n\r\nThen i wake up to my own alarm from the previous day at 8:10. What. A conversation ensues:\r\n\r\nMe: Its 8:10\r\n\r\nSister: YEAH! (as if its my fault)\r\n\r\nMe: You're supposed to wake me up\r\n\r\nS: You could have stayed up!\r\n\r\nMe: So???\r\n\r\nThen i ended up taking her to her school instead of the bus stop, which she knows i hate doing but she has been hating going to the bus stop recently so i wouldn't be surprised if she did this on purpose. We were yelling at each other the whole way there because she insisted on arguing over it and i just didn't want to dwell on it. Her argument was that i should have stayed up the extra time when she woke me up at 7:40, and that it was all my fault that we were late. Then she slammed my car door and wouldn't even say goodbye. Sure she's 13, but its not within her character to go without saying \"i love you\"\r\n\r\nFor a little extra background, right know i'm in pretty bad pain because i just got my wisdom teeth taken out on monday. The pain isn't severe, its been a few days, but it hurts the most in the morning because i haven't taken anything yet. She knows that.\r\n\r\nAlso, the reason i'm driving her is because my mom is working early in the morning and my dad is out of town, leaving only me. She doesn't even need to be driven. When i was her age, i walked to my bus stop that was even farther. Still, even though i drive her in my car that i pay for gas in, i have never complained. (Except for now, of course)\r\n\r\nWhether ITA or not doesn't really matter, she's going to treat me like i am either way. I just want to know if i really am in the wrong."}, "2011": {"id": "ewyul2", "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend nearby when going out (Partying)?", "body": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nmy (19,m) girlfriend(20,f) and i had a little argument about this topic so i would like to ask you guys for your opinion.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI am hosting a small party tomorrow with 8ish friends and after that we want to go out and party. I told my girlfriend explicitly that i dont want her around for following reasons:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n1: She gets drunk pretty easy, and despite knowing that still get herself wasted to the point where i have to take care of her. This has let us to leaving a couple of parties early. She is an adult woman and should be able to know when she had enough, i am not her babysitter. We haved talked about this twice, and still she wrecked herself. I want to have fun too, and to get (resposibly) drunk, but this is not possbile since i have to always watch out for her.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n2: She is quite jealous. And since i am a person who A: likes social contact and B: doesnt not look like someone who has been run over by a truck, we have a small argument each time a random girl is talking with me. Not flirting, literally talking is enought. She usually makes quite a scene and i am sick of this. We have discussed this issue, yet nothing has changed.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo i told her that i dont want her to go out with me tomorrow and she is really hurt and upset. My friends are split, some say that i am in the right since she is not improving her behavior, some say it is fucked up from me uninvite my own girlfriend.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n1: I think that due to keeping it short it very much seems like my SO and i are not that close. Thats not really true, we click great together and this is really the only problem we are having\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n2: She drinks rarely, but when she drinks she overdues herself most time\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n3: We are in Germany so no underage drinking.\r\n\r\nSo reddit, AITA?"}}
