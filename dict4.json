He found me on Facebook, and we chatted on messenger occasionally. Eventually the pm\u2019s got more frequent and personal.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had aspergers, lived at home with his parents, and didn\u2019t have many friends. I vented to him about relationship/university problems. It was easy to vent to him, as I considered our online friendship \u201cless real\u201d than any of my IRL friends. Talking to him was almost like having a sentient diary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom started messaging me daily, and the personal information he disclosed began to make me feel uncomfortable. He told me that he was a virgin, had never had a girlfriend, and that he had some\u2026 unusual fetishes. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe talked in detail about being sexually aroused by girls urinating (specifically urinating in public and being really embarrassed about it?). I didn\u2019t think much of this, until he started sending me images of girls pissing themselves. He even tried to add me to a (private) peeing fetish Facebook group. I told him that I didn\u2019t appreciate him forcing his fetishes on me. He apologised and said that he had no one else to talk to about it, and that I was his \u201cbest friend\u201d. This was weird to me, as I didn\u2019t consider him a friend, let alone a \u201cbest friend\u201d. He\u2019s a pretty pitiful guy, and I immediately felt guilty for being creeped out by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTom asked me a lot of personal questions about my body, specifically, whether I\u2019d had any \u201caccidents\u201d recently. If we were talking and I\u2019d say \u201cbrb\u201d, he\u2019d say \u201care you going to the bathroom? Are you about to burst?\u201d. Under the circumstances of his pee fetish, it creeped me out. I told him that I wasn\u2019t okay with it, but he wouldn\u2019t stop.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the therapy sessions and the sexual inuendo\u2019s, my feelings of disdain for Tom began to trump my pity for him. I dreaded going on Facebook because I didn\u2019t want him to see my online status and try to talk to me. At one point I told him that we didn\u2019t have anything in common anymore, and that I was too busy to maintain a friendship with him. He got very upset and asked \u201cwhy everyone in my life hates me?\u201d. I felt guilty and tried to continue the \u201cfriendship\u201d. But Tom was bringing me down. Every time I talked to him, I felt bad about myself. This sounds awful, but I didn\u2019t want to even associate myself to this creepy, socially retarded man. And he WOULD NOT STOP talking about peeing/me peeing/me peeing in public. I hated myself for being compliant.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t want to have a difficult conversation with him, or outright dump him. Instead, I just filtered his messages.\r\nI haven\u2019t spoken to Tom in 6 months, and I don\u2019t plan on changing that.

This made sense -my mom is Christian but not religious and my dad isn't Christian, so seeing me and some sights could be worth some traveling on Xmas. My 2nd hangup was that I have siblings, \"S\" (24F) and \"B\" (27M) who live near/with my parents respectively, and I didn't want to take my parents away from them on the holiday. My mom countered that they could simply celebrate on Xmas Eve, which I found reasonable. Still, I said that I only wanted them to come on Xmas if that was the *only way* they could afford it. \r\n\r\nI honestly did not think that my sibs would object. S has had to split holidays between us and her SOs family for a few years, so we've had to alter our plans and work around her schedule before. B (who has no SO) is known in our family for not having an opinion on almost anything. I would, of course, want their approval, but I figured they would understand if it was the ONLY WAY I could see our parents.\r\n\r\nMy parents found other tics, but I discovered later that S was absolutely NOT OK with plan A. She argued that 1) I made the decision to go abroad so it would be unfair if I 'took' our parents on Xmas 2) they should be home 3) B didn't have an SO and would be alone and 4) I could come home. I gave her the same reasons I wrote above (including the change from 6 to 12 months), but she wasn\u2019t persuaded.\r\n\r\nConversely, I thought that her prioritizing her Xmas over my ability to see my parents for an entire year was a bit low.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIt's probably dumb to post this since it ended up fine, but I think about it a lot. I have long been accused by S of being selfish/entitled, so I'm scared that IATA. \r\n\r\nIn sum: My parents could only afford to visit me abroad on Xmas Day.

One of my uncle's who isn't doing too well right now and has a mental illness also gave us a card with $5 in it and this didn't bother me because I know where he is in life and it was just nice of him to give us anything at all.  \r\nWhile sending out thank you cards I typically wrote something along the lines of \"thank you for the generous gift of money and for coming to our ceremony, love Mr and Mrs.\" However, on my cousins who left us the $5, I simply wrote \"dear so and so, thank you for the $5.\" \r\nI thought it was fitting because while I did not say anything mean, I hope they get the point that it was a little rude to come to a wedding and only give the new couple $5 when we gave them $100 at their wedding and we know they are well off.  I would have even preferred if they didn't give us anything! But just the $5 in a card really rubbed me the wrong way.  I feel that typical courtesy for a wedding is $50 a plate.  And giving $5 for a couple does not even cover drinks for them. \r\nI thought maybe they would get the message with my petty thank you card even though everything I wrote was true, but husband and my parents think I was being rude and think it will stir the pot in my family.  So AITA for sending that thank you card?\r\nTLDR; Cousins who are well off gave us a card with $5 in it for a wedding gift and I sent them a blatant \"thank you for the $5\" thank you note.\r\n\r\n"}, "782": {"id": "d7o3du", "title": "AITA for not paying for the damage I caused to my GF's car", "body": "I (M39) I borrowed my GF's (3 months) car with her permission.

My grandparents on my fathers side (good people) also passed a couple years back, and most of my aunts/uncles are either deceased or I'm not close to at all. This will be relevant in a paragraph or two.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother on my mothers side is in a nursing home and will very likely die soon. She hasn't been healthy for a while, and recently fell and broke her hip. Apparently it's getting worse and worse. Apparently she's been asking to see me over and over.\r\n\r\nThe only family I ever see anymore, my Godmother and cousin both want me to go visit her before she passes. Their opinions matter to me \r\n\r\nHere's the thing though, my grandmother was an abusive piece of shit to my mom and her siblings. She'd beat my mother as a young child, once broke a chair over my 6 year old uncles back when he was crying at night and woke her up, and did all sorts of terrible things. Things like giving my mom amphetamines at 10 years old to make her clean the house over and over again. On top of that, she played the favorite game with her siblings. One sister in particular was \"favored\" and pampered, and was never treated like that.\r\n\r\nIt deeply effected my mother (which was clear to me even as a child) to the point that as she was in hospice, half in and out of consciousness, she sobbed to my great aunt and asked \"why didn't she ever love me\". It was heartbreaking to watch and listen to.\r\n\r\nShe was never like that to me, but my mother very rarely left me alone with her.\r\n\r\nWhen my mother passed, I was planning to have her cremated, with a very small private funeral due to money issues. My grandmother offered to pay for a large funeral/burial. Personally, I don't care about that kind of thing, it's the memories that matter to me. But my godmother/cousins encouraged me to go along with it, and I did because I felt that giving my mothers friends/family a place to mourn outweighed my apathy about the entire thing.\r\n\r\nI feel almost obligated to go see this woman because of the funeral, and because of the last of my close family urging me to go. But I don't want to. I don't feel she deserves my visit, and I wouldn't be genuine if I did go. I honestly don't give a shit about her. When she dies, she dies. She brought so much suffering upon her children in general, and my mother in particular, I don't feel it'll be a loss to the world.\r\n\r\nWould I be an asshole if I don't go see this woman?

My brother has since before their girl came been the sole provider, she finished her studies while pregnant, no1 wants to hire a pregnany lady, so their income is kinda low. My dad has a 4 bedroom house so they stayed there since the girl pregnancy until recently. Seeing that they were getting a girl like me I offered them EVERYTHING I had, just gave it away so they can save up for a house of their own. Though they didnt like alot of the stuff, she insisted she wanted to buy 100pcs of clothing for a newborn (big mistake, they barely have the time to use them before they outgrow them).

We love each other very much, but we rarely find something that we both do in terms of entertainment.  But besides that, if it wasn\u2019t for her pushing me in my career, I wouldn\u2019t be in the position I am now making tons of money and doing what I love to do!\r\n\r\nBit of a backstory:  She is originally from Turkey and I met her when I was stationed there.  She WAS a huge soccer fan and supported Fenerbah\u00e7e. I have no clue about Turkish soccer and choose to support Galatasaray...I don\u2019t know why I picked them.  When they played each other, we had our friendly rivalry moments, but nothing serious.\r\n\r\n We got married and then when we moved to England a few months later.  I didn\u2019t really support a team there, but just enjoyed the soccer culture overall.  However, apparently I \u201coverloaded\u201d her with soccer during our 4 years there that she doesn\u2019t find any joy in watching it anymore.\r\n\r\nWe came to the states in 2014 and if she felt overloaded with soccer in England..she absolutely HATES baseball! Her complaints about it: She doesn\u2019t understand it, its too boring, there are too many rules, opposite fans are sitting next to each other and not fighting (no joke, that was a 100% honest true complaint she has).\r\n\r\nOne night, we had a talked about something we can do together.  Naturally I say \u201clet\u2019s go to a baseball game.\u201d  There was no bargaining or anything, she said no.  She suggested the music fest at the local Turkish Community Center.  \r\n\r\nNow this is where the talk turns deep...when we do stuff, 90% of the time we do what she wants, 5% its with her friends, and 5% its something neutral we both \u201cagree\u201d to do (movies, hike, or stay in).  My choices of what to do are (according to her) usually too boring (sports, musicals/plays, museums), too far (wine tasting), or we\u2019re too old (raves, clubs, concerts).  I debated this with her and we talked for a long time.  But the main points I brought up was my unease to go to the music fest because:\r\n\r\n1.  I don\u2019t know Turkish and don\u2019t know the music.\r\n\r\n2.  I know of her friends, but I can\u2019t relate to their husbands who are all Turkish.\r\n\r\nFinally, we compromised:  I\u2019ll go to the music fest on Saturday IF she goes with me to the game on Wed night.  With a big SIGH she says \u201cfine.\u201d  I jump online and book the tickets for the Wed night game and even mark it in her phone.  \r\n\r\nWed morning and she calls me asking what is this event on her calendar.  I remind her of the deal we made and she completely denies ever making a deal with me!  I told her she said \u201cfine\u201d which I took it as a \u201cokay lets do it.\u201d  But it wasn\u2019t according to her and I should\u2019ve asked to clarify.  I told her if shes going to the game and she downright says no! I remind her that the deal was if she went to the game, I would go to the Music Fest with her...this leads to a huge argument of her calling me immature and selfish blah blah blah.  \r\n\r\nWed night comes and she doesn\u2019t go to the game. Sat is almost here, would I be the asshole if I cancel on her?"}, "817": {"id": "dmsbbe", "title": "WIBTA if I paid an extra fee in rent to never have to clean?", "body": "A little background: I (23F) live at home with my parents and sister. I have other siblings that have moved out. I work full time and am financially stable enough to live on my own, but my parents\u2019 generosity has allowed me to live debt free and save up a lot so that when I do leave, I will have a really great start.\r\n\r\nI pay rent to live here. It is decent but for sure much cheaper than if I were to get an apartment in my area. My mother has stated the rent is going to an account that will eventually be given back to me when I get married and/or want to buy a house, but I\u2019ve told her I don\u2019t mind if she and my dad use the money if they need it. I doubt they would unless it was an emergency. So basically, the rent is just an investment into myself and my wedding or house.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s where the dilemma comes in: my parents approached me and said if I was willing to pay an extra $100 a month, they would never ask me to do community/family chores EVER again. This doesn\u2019t mean I would live like a slob. I clean my own room, do my own laundry, and do my best to always clean up after myself when I use or eat something. But basically, I would never get asked to do the dishes again, or anything like that where the family makes the mess and one person usually ends up cleaning it up.\r\n\r\nMy family is, frankly, pretty slobbish. I am not perfect either and it\u2019s been a journey to become as neat as I am today, but I hate doing dishes, or cleaning up clutter I didn\u2019t make. We already pay a group of awesome people to do our mopping/dusting/vacuuming, so it\u2019s really just the dishes and the clutter around the house, most of which, frankly, is my sister\u2019s. If I paid this extra fee, it would basically ensure my sister is responsible for her own messes, I wouldn\u2019t have to do dishes (other than my own), and I would be investing an extra $100 a month into my own wedding or house, plus I work nights, so when I am awake and actually able to clean it usually disrupts my family\u2019s sleep. It feels like a win.\r\n\r\nBUT. I was raised in a family where respect and helping out is paramount. I feel like I\u2019m leaving them high and dry if I don\u2019t help out once in a while. I almost feel like my parents are testing my character and if I choose to spend extra money just to not clean I will have failed in their eyes. I obviously wouldn\u2019t stop doing my own chores/laundry and would always make the effort to clean my own dishes and clean my messes.

My instructor is a 40/50-something y/o man who's always been okay with me, respectful, I have no complaints about my lessons with him or anything.\r\n\r\nOne of the last lessons of the course has the students matched in pairs with their instructor, instead of being one-on-one.  Basically the idea is while one student drives, the other sits at the back and fills in a sheet evaluating the other student's driving, recognizing safety risks and stuff, and then we switch.\r\n\r\nFor that lesson, the other student I was matched with was a girl around 18-20 y/o.  The instructor made jokes with sexual undertones on like three separate occasions, when he was never like that with me.  Since then, I've had my last 2 lessons alone with him, and he was \"back to normal\", being okay and not making any jokes like that (ofc, I'm male).\r\n\r\nThe jokes were pretty unambiguously sexual and forced, like I don't think it's just me taking it the wrong way or being unable to take a joke.  One time, the girl made a casual comment about being cold, and the instructor said something like \"Well you're just wearing these little leggings, you're really asking for it\".  Another time, he asked me to cross out the highway part of the evaluation sheet since we weren't gonna do any highway driving.  I said something like \"Should I just leave it blank?  It's gonna be pretty dirty\", to which he answered \"Well that's okay, I'm pretty sure she likes it dirty\", clearly meant in a sexual way with the tone he used.\r\n\r\nThe jokes made me pretty uncomfortable but I didn't say anything and the girl didn't either.  I don't know if she felt uncomfortable too and just said nothing, or if they actually talked about it and she's okay with it, since I've only seen them for that one special lesson, whereas she's had 15+ lessons alone with him, so maybe I'm not in the best place to put in a complaint?  But then the jokes did make *me* uncomfortable, so I could be justified in putting in a complaint regardless of how the girl felt about it?  I don't wanna be a complicit bystander but I also don't wanna stick my nose where it doesn't belong.  Also worth noting that most people who learn to drive here are between 16-18 y/o, I'm one of the older ones since I waited a bit, and the thought of my instructor acting like this with (potentially) all of his female students in that age range kinda creeps me out.\r\n\r\nSo what do you say, Reddit?

She kept going on about how she\u2019s so happy and cant believe sister would do this for her. At this point i was a bit upset/angry so i asked why it was ok to accept sister\u2019s money to visit but not any of our offers? Her response : \u201cWell we figured you wouldnt be too well off after and would be hurting for money.\u201d She then went on to say how its not fair that im angry at something that makes her this happy and i should just be happy for her and im just an ass like my father.

For monetary reasons and familial ones, we were satisfied with two kids. We agreed that after the second child was born, I'd get a vasectomy.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of our second child, I began to schedule an appointment to go get the damn thing, and as I'm consulting with her, she says that she doesn't want me to get it because she wants a third kid. At first, I kind of laughed it off, but then I realized she was serious. I asked her what her reasons were. To the best of my recollection (and I'm trying to be faithful to her logic and reasoning here), her reasons were:\r\n\r\n\\- We have enough money to support three kids comfortably (this is more or less true, but we'd be spread thinner and we'd be able to save less)  \r\n\\- She had two siblings, and she feels it's a beneficial environment to grow up in. (I wouldn't know, I only had 1 sibling).\r\n\r\n\\- I'm not the one who has to \"go\" through pregnancy (she's right... but I'm not sure if that's enough reason to deviate from the plan)\r\n\r\nAfter hearing her plead her case, I decided to drop it for the time being. As silly as it was, I assumed that maybe it was some lingering pregnancy hormones influencing her desire to want another kid... I'm not a doctor, so be gentle.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I left it alone and came back to the idea later. I asked her if this is really what she wanted; saying I still *really* wanted to get a vasectomy. She said that we made the plan hastily and that we didn't have to stick to it. She also said that by getting the vasectomy, I would be essentially \"taking\" a third child away from her.\r\n\r\nI thought about it for a while but came to the same conclusions. About a week later, I told her that I'd be going to get the procedure soon. I set it up so that my parents would take care of the kids, and I'd take time off of work so I wasn't placing an undue burden on her. She was expectedly upset and told me that if I went through with it, I'd be less of a man. I went and got the surgery, and my wife is still mad at me.\r\n\r\nAt the end of it all, I'm just sitting here wondering if I'm in the wrong. I still don't want to have kids, but if somehow I cave in the near future, I can get it reversed, we can adopt, etc. I'm starting to see what my wife is talking about, but I'm not sure if I'm just falling for some logical fallacy and I'd like some detached strangers to set me straight. If there are any parts that need clarification, ask away: I don't want this to be one of those one-sided story type of deals (although, I can't *literally* tell you what my wife was thinking, only what she told me).\r\n\r\nP.S: I'm using a throwaway account.

I\u2019ve met Bride (24f) 3 times and friend around 10. For fiance\u2019s sake I agreed to be in their wedding, after all, Bride and I get on really well. I\u2019ve only been in 1 other wedding and it was more of an elopement.\r\n\r\nThis bridesmaids dress was close to $200, as was the stag party. Wedding etiquette says Fiance and I should each give a gift at the wedding, and since most things on the registry were far out of our price range we bought the gifts already-totaling over $100. We don't live near the venue, and we found an Airbnb not too far for $300.\r\n\r\nBride and I\u2019ve talked before about how sensitive my skin is. I have dry skin and get painful acne from many makeup products. I also mentioned how bad I felt that the bride of the other wedding I was in paid someone $70 to do my makeup for her wedding - noting how expensive it was for such a poor result due to my skin. At this point the bride said she was thinking of having us get our makeup done, but said she\u2019d cover half, so I'm thinking $35ish. Not a big deal, I\u2019ll take it off after pictures. Bride also knows Fiance and I are unemployed students.\r\n\r\nBride sent the bridesmaids a text with her venmo asking us to each send her $100 for wedding hair and makeup. $100 is a LOT for me right now. I\u2019m living on savings and even if I GET a job, licensing won't allow me to start until September. The average cost for wedding hair and makeup for bridesmaids is around $150, so this pretty expensive considering that this is in a very cheap city. Etiquette also says if the bridesmaids have to have their hair and makeup professionally done, the bride should pay for it.\r\n\r\nBride\u2019s already 6 figures in debt, and I feel that if you can't afford to have something at your wedding, you shouldn't have it. My mom and Fiance\u2019s Mom offered to pay as a birthday gift to me, but selfishly it's about principle. She knew I'm unemployed, that I would think it was a lot of money and that I have sensitive skin. She never hinted it would cost this much. I don't want my parents spending 100 dollars this \u2013 my face isn\u2019t important here. This money could help me do other things. Why should my parents pay for her wedding extra? They're retired and it feels so wrong accepting money from my mom or his for this.\r\n\r\nMom and MIL say I'm being unreasonable and this will cause a rift between fiance and friend that might affect his participation in our wedding. They say I'm being petty and I should just do it and clean my face when photos are done. Fiance thinks $100 is unreasonable and doesn't care if I kindly tell her I can't afford it, because he and other groomsmen have their own issues with Bride. He's sure friend isn\u2019t behind this and would think it was ridiculous if he understood. AITA?\r\n\r\nTLDR; Bride wants me to pay $100 for wedding hair and makeup knowing i'm unemployed and have sensitive skin. My parents offered to pay.

We signed a lease together last year which ends on November 1st. He mentioned that he planned moving out since April or May this year.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago, he non chalantley mentioned that he planned on leaving furniture in his previous room, which is the bigger bedroom of the two-bedroom apartment. I spoke to him saying that he could not leave the furniture in the room because I wanted the landlord to check for any damages so I could receive my full security deposit at the end of the lease next year. I was extremely surprised because I planned on not only moving all my furniture to the other room but creating the second bedroom as a guest bedroom for my parents to visit, since they are coming the second week of November. He knew of my plans, since I can only walk about 8 steps in my room. We had just spoken yesterday about this and he said that it was no problem to get everything out by November 1st.\r\n\r\n But today at my birthday party, he got really upset at me saying that he was sick and had no way to move the furniture by November 1st. He said that he would be moving all of the things within the first week of November but he has previously left furniture at his last apartment for almost a year when he was living with another friend. His girlfriend was also there and shared her point of view as well. She said that they only knew exactly where they were moving two weeks beforehand and possibly couldn't have known that they weren't able to take all of the furniture.\r\n\r\nI told him that he had to move everything out of the big bedroom and I was more than willing to give him the storage unit that the apartment had so he could store things. He later insinuated that I was putting him in an early grave, and did not care about his situation at all. In fact, during this, he by accidently sent a text to me meant for his girlfriend saying \" I don\u2019t want to fight with 23[F] on her birthday but she clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about everything I have going on.\"\r\n\r\nI do care about him, but I also have quite a bit going on with school, work, and my own illness. \r\n\r\nAITA for wanting him to move his items out of the room?

He said he had no time, but I feel as if he just did this to himself. \r\n\r\ntl;dr: AITA for wanting my roommates furniture out by the end of his lease term?

At the time I was 19 and he was 47. Clearly with hindsight this was definitely a case of him being creepy and predatory but at the time I felt really grown up and special. We cut it off at the end of that academic year because I went to do a year abroad and we weren't serious enough for long distance to work. We hooked up a couple more times when I was back, but that was it.\r\n\r\nFast forward to now. A new girl joined our team at work and she and I became quite friendly quite quickly, and we're now \"grab a couple of drinks after work\" type coworkers. We did this last night and we got onto the topic of old flames. I mentioned shagging my professor, and she asked which one. I told her and she got really quiet, and then left. She later texted me saying that he was her father and this was the first she'd heard of him being interest in men. It's worth noting, at the time I was seeing him, he was seperated from his wife and they were divorcing *because* he's gay. I suppose the kids weren't told for whatever reason and I've pretty well dropped him in it. He sent me an angry text telling me to leave the past in the past and she's not speaking to me.

Since we had been together for a good amount of time now and getting fairly serious, I proposed the idea that I try to get a meeting to introduce her to my relatives. She was hesitant to the idea. My relatives are from a conservative culture (Asian country) and she was worried the age difference between is an issue. They had a feeling I was going out with her at the start of our relationship, and I denied it. They said they weren't comfortable with me dating an older woman. My gf told me she wanted me to lie to my relatives and say I was just on a vacation with a friend. I told her I didn't feel comfortable lying to them about this. They likely had an idea that we were dating anyway, and it would come up eventually. I felt lying about it would make it seem worse. Plus, we are planning to close the distance within 1.5 yrs, they are definitely going to find out when marriage comes into the picture. I felt it was best to get the news out now, and they'll warm up to the idea. I just felt very uncomfortable blatantly lying to them about our relationship.\r\n\r\nBy this point with my relatives, I felt like it could go either way; they're not on the far end of conservatism so I thought there would be a good chance they would be open to it after some coaxing. Eventually, my gf said she wasn't against the idea entirely and said she'd prepare herself for it. I said that I'd bring it up to them a month before our trip. I dropped the ball on that, because of some anxiety on my end. I messaged my grandmother a week before our trip asking if she wanted to meet with me and my gf. She said that we shouldn't plan a meeting but meet and talk about it first; she was very against this. When my gf heard this she very understandably hurt and told me she wished I would have just lied about it to protect her. I should have been willing to do so if I cared about her and that I don't care about her. She said I shouldn't have put off messaging my grandma and it rushed things which made the situation worse. I explained my side, it's just that I felt things would look so much worse if I lied. We dropped the subject and a week later went on our trip.\r\n\r\nIt's been a few months since that trip and just now she brought up the subject again. She's been unable to drop the feeling that I disregarded her feelings and failed to protect her. With this being a LDR, it's really put a strain on our day to day interactions. Was I the asshole for feeling like lying to my relatives was an unreasonable way to go about things? Of course in hindsight, had I known how my family would have reacted, I would have made different choices. But I feel like I had in mind what was best for the relationship. I have a trip to see her for a 2 weeks in September and I'm trying to understand her and try to mend things the best I can before then."}, "845": {"id": "bdo84e", "title": "WIBTA if I shorted my landlord on rent?", "body": "Please read before you berate me. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Lease states that landlord is required to pay for repairs that are not through intentional damage.

My landlord lives in the apartment directly above us. My landlord (LL from here on out) and knows that we both have a LOT of problems in our respective personal lives and has been very understanding when we argue; it's both of our first times having to deal with all kinds of bills at once and we don't always see eye to eye on a lot of things so we argue, and I didn't realize he can hear every single word from his apartment. He's a very good landlord, always on top of repairs generally within 24 hours he has someone come out to fix things on top of very timely replies. Well about a week ago our shower pipe broke and I didn't realize until I was actually in the shower. I texted him and let him know that it needed fixed, no response and it's been 5 days. My bf had texted him as well two days ago and LL won't answer us about a repair and nobody has been sent out. Even though he lives upstairs he's rarely home so it's pretty hard to catch him and knock on his door and ask about it.\r\n\r\nMy question is, AITA if we short him on rent ONLY because we now have to pay for the repair and parts ourselves? My bf knows how to fix it and it's somewhat cheap, but it's not our job to fix broken pipes (written in the lease) and LL refuses to answer us about getting it fixed?

I'm an ex heroin addict myself so I know how drugs can make you fuckin insane and I know how important it can be to re establish bonds with people you love while in recovery. I'll note I never did anything quite as screwed up as he did while I was in the thick of it, but I figured every case is different and recovery has taught me that everyone deserves a second chance. \r\n\r\nTurns out that I was wrong in this case.

As a result he's constantly pestering my boyfriend for money and will throw a tantrum if he's told no. BF works for minimum wage in a restaurant and is currently on part time hours as he's recovering from a sports injury. He hasn't got heaps of money to spare. However, if he doesn't give his brother money when he asks for it, brother goes on tirades, telling him he's selfish and an asshole and asking why he doesn't care about his own flesh and blood etc. He's the same way about getting rides places too, even though bf has been instructed to limit his driving as much as possible until his injured foot is fully healed. \r\n\r\nBrother has also once again destroyed his relationship with their parents and their sisters by being a generally manipulative manchild. I've reached a place where I think brother has worn out the second chance he was given, and I believe my boyfriend should cut ties with him again. BF is an immensely sweet guy and he hates to see anyone hurt, even if it means he gets hurt himself, and is having a difficult time letting his brother go. Brother himself caught wind of the fact that I want him out of BFs life and sent me some really pretty nasty messages about it, mostly insulting my appearance, throwing homophobic slurs and implying that as I'm also a former addict and have mental health issues which cause occasional bouts of intense paranoia and trust issues, that I'm the same as him. I'd like to think he's wrong because I'm dealing with my illnesses using medication and therapy, but he maybe does have a point. I'll also point out that he effectively ruined my boyfriend's Christmas with one of his tantrums and in the message he asked why I even care about Christmas since I'm a \"fucking kike\". My boyfriend confronted him about the messages and he apologised for all but the last thing, so that's the kind of dude we're dealing with. He's really starting to cause tension in our relationship and I want him gone but bf keeps insisting that he can't turn his back on family and that he wants to give his brother a chance to better himself.

Consequently, me not knowing this, I acquired quite a few nasty texts from co-worker basically saying he wasnt coming in on saturday and that friday is MY day off.....

I'm not blaming the dog at all, but from the second I walked in the door she wouldn't stop barking at me, and she is a big dog, also acting like she was nipping at my hands. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without her barking continuously outside the door. I was getting uncomfortable at this point, but we retired to his room and I thought, \"Ok! Rough start, but let's have a good fun sexy time!\" I wanted to be in the moment and enjoy getting to explore this person's body for the first time, but that dog barked literally every second we were having sex. The whole time non-stop. We make dinner, to dog barking at me. We went on a walk, the dog barked at me, we came back and started to wind down to go to bed but the dog wouldn't sleep unless it was in the room with us and she kept coming up to me in the night and just staring at me and if I moved she'd start barking and growling. I felt paralyzed. I realized at about 4 am that I was having a panic attack because I felt trapped, I couldn't move or leave without the dog barking more and I was exhausted and stressed. I stayed just frozen in panic for hours. eventually Wallace moved, looked over and realizing I was awake asked if I was ok. I felt like the interaction unfroze me suddenly and I just stammered I had to leave, that I had a nice time with him but that I had to go immediately and I quickly got up and gathered my things and left. \r\n\r\nSince that incident, I just don't find Wallace attractive to me.

Eldest bro has only gone back once 8 yrs ago after immigration. 2nd bro had two visits similar to me. My family in country M never treated us poorly. My last visit was in Nov. My grandma is over 100 years old & I have found memories of her (even though we could never communicate because of language barriers). \r\n*****\r\nMy maternal grandfather in country T passed away mid-last year. Bros and I rushed back to see him before he passed (mom was already there). My dad paid for our last min plane tickets so we don't have regrets. He was there for my maternal ext family - provided moral support when my grandfather was hospitalized, humbly attended the funeral when repeatedly invited, despite bad blood w/my mother. \r\n\r\nLast night I couldn't sleep, and my dad msged me asking for urgent help with changing his plane ticket dates (he already had tickets going back to visit for Lunar NY). Told me my GM is in the hospital (negligence in home care leading to life threatening condition. She was otherwise fairly healthy). He said he wasn't going to tell me if he didn't run into trouble with the booking system. \r\n\r\n**He told me to not tell my mom (no problem), or my brothers.** He said he will tell my brothers himself when the time is right. \r\n \r\nI'm feeling guilty keeping this information from my brothers. I know my dad doesn't want us to worry because there's nothing we could do - can't even make it there (lack of direct flights). He himself might not make it either... \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I ask my brothers if my dad has said anything to them or tell them what happened?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nSince he didn't specify to not mention to anyone else, I did tell two aunts in country T, both of whom my dad gets along with. I asked them to reach out to him when he returns to country T after the trip if they're available. I don't want him to be grieving alone during Lunar New Year. My aunts see him as family even if the divorce is finalized.\r\n\r\nEdit 2:\r\nI'm also hesitant because I'm not sure if my brothers would even care much, considering there's nothing we can do. Maybe I just feel like I need to grieve with them because they're the only family I have here. I'm afraid they don't have the same emotional attachment to the situation (as I just saw my grandma a few months ago). My second brother visited Apr 2019 and my grandma (exhibiting early dementia symptoms) couldn't figure out who he was. My brother was a bit hurt by that and I think detached himself from the situation. My immediate family dynamic is weird..dysfunctional. My mother is emotionally manipulative. My brothers physically abused me in the past, we aren't super close. My dad was a workaholic before, always stressed and used to have anger issues. I became estranged from my family at 18 because of my mental health struggles and toxic environment with my immediate family was not helping. My dad eventually did a 180 take on mental health, attended seminars in psychiatric field and became my main emotional support."}, "882": {"id": "eafed2", "title": "AITA for refusing to let my older sister back into my family\u2019s life?", "body": "So I (23F) am the second oldest in my family. My older sister (27F) has just been kicked out of her long time boyfriends house tonight and is asking my mom to let her come back into our home and live with us again. To give some background:\r\n\r\nMy older sister and I never got along. My family went through a very hard situation years ago (when I was 14). We were leaving my abusive father (5 kids and my mom) and we arrived at a homeless shelter specifically for women in abusive relationships and such and we were there for years. In these years my sister began what I consider her torment on our family. In my eyes she was the root of all major fights and issues, she began hitting my mother, swearing at her, just everything disrespectful while my mother tried her best to help my sister (she had depression) which my mother also had so she knew it was hard to overcome and get help but our family spent YEARS trying to help her and she just never could hold a job, clean her room or even herself. She just would feed off of us. Now it gets to the part of why I hate her. I was 17 and I started a retail job while in HS to help support my family. I was working 40+ hours a week and getting decent grades in school. I basically became the breadwinner of my family after a year because I kept getting promotions. This made me resent her for making me step up while she was the fuck up doing whatever she wanted with NO consequences. She was just gaming all day. She was kicked out multiple times with her every time except this last, getting on the floor begging my mother to come back and promising to stop the lying, deceiving and torment she would put us through... she never kept those promises. \r\n\r\nPresent day. I kicked her out almost 2 years ago after me and another sibling(21F) snapping at the YEARS of the same abusive cycle from her tormenting my mother and abusing her help. She tried making amends about a year ago and I shut her out, my youngest siblings don\u2019t hold anything against her since they don\u2019t remember much. The 17 year old sibling has acknowledged that bringing her back would cause a lot of distress in the family when we finally moved into a good spot. So after all this background I ask.... am I the asshole for telling my mother that my older sister is not allowed back in this house because I am tired of this cycle?\r\n\r\nEdit: I feel it is only right to add that my mother has asked I forgive my sister because she has been \u201cin a good place\u201d for what i believe is almost a year. By good place she means holding a job consistently. Although she is trying to make amends and ask for forgiveness I don\u2019t want people pushing me for when I should forgive her. I may forgive her in 10 years but today I will not and neither has my other sibling (21F) who used to play defense for her all the time ."}, "883": {"id": "bi1ozo", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for every meal my very independent girlfriend(25f) and I (31m) go out for?", "body": "My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years.

If I spoke up for myself when this happened, I would continue to get verbally bashed and shit-talked about to the other employees AND customers, with and without my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\\-Even though the hourlies did upwards of 50% of the job. While making $40/day, even a $5 tip would go a long way.\r\n\r\n\\-If I did something incorrectly I would get aggressively verbally beaten and have my position threatened.\r\n\r\n\\-There was A LOT of drama between the commission-makers.

Also I apologize for the format because I\u2019m typing this on my phone. Also to avoid confusion the ages mentioned are current. \r\n\r\nSo I (18 M) have had a rough childhood. My mom (50\u2019s F) and dad (40\u2019s M) got divorced when I was about 10. I was the only one there for my younger brother (11 M) and older sister (19 F). Essentially, my mom and dad would put us in the middle and try to pit us against each other, but instead my siblings and I became closer. The divorce was rough on all of us because my mom and dad are both narcissistic in their own ways. But that\u2019s a story for another time.\r\n\r\nSo I am in college about 1000 miles away from my mom, dad, and brother and 1000 miles away from my sister. One of the reasons I came here was to start my own life. I never came out here with the intention of not talking to my family. Even though college can be stressful at times, I still find time to talk to my dad, brother, sister and mom. I love them all to pieces and I cannot stress that enough. \r\n\r\nWhenever I call my dad, the conversation goes great. Even though our views can differ on quite a few things, he is clearly supportive of me and whatever I want to do. When I call my brother, we talk about how much we miss each other and how our classes are going. These conversations are what I expected from my family.\r\n\r\nWhen I call my mom, however, it\u2019s a different story. It doesn\u2019t matter what I do, she\u2019s never satisfied with how college is going for me. Today, we spoke on the phone and she said that I didn\u2019t take care of myself because I told her I didn\u2019t take my trash out. She judges me in everything I do because it\u2019s not something she would. This likely stems from her wanting me to go to college locally and play baseball when I instead decided to come here. She makes it seem like the only way I\u2019ll get her support is if I do what she wants me to. \r\n\r\nAs for my sister, she undermines me whenever I talk to her and insists that I communicate with my mom even though she knows to what extent I\u2019m frustrated with my mom.\r\n\r\nThe last straw was when I found out that, even though my mom said that she would pay for none of my sisters or my education, she\u2019s paying 50 K A YEAR FOR MY SISTER TO GO TO COLLEGE AND REFUSES TO EVEN OFFER TO HELP ME. \r\n\r\nI feel shitty for even writing this tbh and I\u2019m at such a loss that I just need an opinion. So random strangers on the internet, WIBTA?\r\n\r\nTLDR-After a nasty divorce, my parents went their separate ways and my sister, brother and I became close. I went to college and it\u2019s clear my mom doesn\u2019t want to support me because I\u2019m not doing what she wants me to.

He also lost his bank card, so he was staying with me rent and bill free plus living costs until he got paid, to which I have not seen this money yet.  Naive, I know.\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago I found out that I was pregnant, and had to arrange an abortion.  He wasn't overly supportive, and when I got upset would say 'it won't matter in a few weeks'.  I came back home to my parents this week because I felt smothered and wanted time away to try and do my essays whilst dealing with crippling morning sickness and emotional strain about the whole thing.  On the day of the abortion (only two days ago), which was twenty minutes away from my house where he's staying, he completely forgot about it.  When I said I was in hospital and couldn't talk, it didn't even click and he assumed it was A&E.  He blamed it on the fact he had worked the rugby weekend; as had my best friend and I heard from her first thing that morning.  He said he was tired and tried to make me feel guilty.  I had a really rough time and ended up with injections in my ass and a drip because I couldn't keep the medication down, but he simply blamed me for not updating him - I was in hospital all day slightly preoccupied - when he hadn't even asked.\r\n\r\nSince I found out about the pregnancy my rationale flooded in about our living situation, and I advised him that since he had a flat in another city, maybe he could use it to commute to and from work in my city because I didn't think it was healthy that we were living together so soon.  He immediately agreed and has had two weeks to organise it, but tomorrow is the day he has to go (also because my parents are furious) and has completely flipped.  He is saying that I have made him homeless and he is having a mental breakdown, has no one to stay with and nowhere to go and is now refusing to talk to me.  He insists that he is going to be 'streeting it' for at least a week.  I am really concerned and feel like a massive arsehole.  I feel so responsible and my one friend says that I can't do that to him, whereas the other says that he is guilt tripping me and will likely find somewhere to stay amongst his 'friends all over the UK' and what about his flat?

They are not such good friends that my mother feels comfortable calling her outright, so I usually ask Ashley if it\u2019s ok for my mom to call Heather.\r\n\r\nMy mom had a very time-sensitive legal situation come up and asked me if it would be ok for her to talk to Heather. I text Ashley, and she responds that her mother had plastic surgery a few weeks ago and is recovering. Because of this she can\u2019t talk for very long, so my mom will have to keep it short. \r\n\r\nI relayed this information to my mom. The call happens, all is well with the universe.\r\n\r\nExcept 20 minutes later Ashley is blowing up my phone, berating me for telling my mom that Heather got plastic surgery. She said that now her mom is screaming at her because Ashley should have kept quiet about the surgery and now everyone will know she\u2019s had work done.\r\n\r\nAll my mom said to Heather was, \u201cI hope you\u2019re recovering well\u201d at the beginning of the call. Ashley continued to send angry texts at me, saying how she\u2019d told me that in confidence.\r\n\r\nI responded that: \r\n1.) Ashley hadn\u2019t told me to keep it a secret\r\n2.) isn\u2019t the point of plastic surgery that your face looks different?? Wouldn\u2019t everyone know you had work done?\r\n3.) I had to give my mom a reason to keep it short as she has trouble keeping things brief (a trait I have apparently inherited, based on this long-ass yarn I\u2019m spinning)\r\n\r\nAshley responds by turning it into a full blown fight. It was probably the worst one we\u2019ve had. \r\n\r\nI like Ashley as a friend but she is incapable of having calm disagreements. She seems to like conflict and picking flights, but I attribute this more to the toxic environment in which she was raised. \r\n\r\nAfter a week of silence, Ashley texts me \u201cHi\u201d like nothing happened. I know she is did this because that\u2019s how she was raised to resolve fights. But I was still angry and wanted an apology.\r\n\r\nShe never apologized, but a year later I foolishly responded to one of her texts and now we\u2019re \u201cfriends\u201d again.  \r\n\r\nTLDR: I told my mom that my best friend\u2019s mom got plastic surgery.

My sister then starts making jokes in front of everyone including our parents and children about how her boyfriend wants rough sex tonight and she jokingly said she bought ear plugs so that our sleep wouldn\u2019t be interrupted. She then covered her mouth with her hand and made moaning noises. It was creepy. \r\n\r\nI took her to the side privately and said \u201cHey, can you tone down the PDA in front of me and my son?

Also this is shortened since my first post was over the character limit so if there\u2019s anymore info you need just let me know and I\u2019ll answer.\r\n\r\nI am scheduled to work at the cat shelter thursdays every other week, however I can take extra shifts if I want. Two days ago, late in the evening, I got an email that said extra volounteers were needed in the evening the following day (i.e. Tuesday). Since I had nothing to do that day/evening I decided to take the shift since literally no one had volunteered to do so yet and obviously someone needs to take care of the cats (and cuddle them!).\r\n\r\nWhen I was on the tube to the cat shelter the next day I called my dad to let him know where I was going but he didn\u2019t answer, so I sent him a text instead.\r\n\r\nMost of the cats at the shelter come from less than stellar situations so they\u2019re kind of shy and jumpy. Because of that we\u2019re not allowed to have our phones with us during our shifts (unless we\u2019re waiting for an important phone call/emergencies) because the ring tone can scare the cats, so as usual I left my phone on silent in a locker when I got to the shelter.\r\n\r\nWhen I was done with my shift I changed into my normal clothes and got my bag with my phone from the locker I put it in and went to the bus stop to wait for the bus. My shift ends at 20:30 so it was about 21:00 at the time, when I was walking to the bus I got my phone from my bag because I was going to listen to music, and I noticed that I had a few missed calls from my dad, so I tried calling him but he didn\u2019t answer.\r\n\r\nEventually I got home (at 22:00) and dad was there, I asked him what we were having for dinner or if they had eaten already. However my dad was apparently very angry and shouted at me for going somewhere without telling him and being out so late at night, and he asked where I had been. He hadn\u2019t gotten my text, which I wasn\u2019t aware of. I told him I had both called AND texted him and that if he was paying attention to his phone when he\u2019s with his girlfriend (they\u2019re not really doing anything special but just enjoying each other\u2019s company I guess) he would have known that I was at the cat shelter.\r\n\r\nSome more things were said and both of us were angry and none apologized, I went to my room and didn\u2019t talk to anyone for the rest of the night. Now I feel kind of bad because he got worried, but I still think he should pay more attention to his phone and answer it when someone calls. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - I took an extra (evening) shift at the cat shelter and my dad got worried because he didn\u2019t know were I was.

I knew it was coming, but it still took me by surprise. We haven't set a date, but am targeting spring 2021.\r\n\r\nI also recently have been looking at breast reduction surgery. I am 5'5\" with 28J breasts. While they are a huge part of who I am, and who I am in my friend circle, there are lots of problems with them. My back and shoulders hurt. I have to buy bras from the UK for a small fortune. I can't run any more, and that is how I love to get my exercise, etc. Walking down the street I get a lot of looks and rude comments. You can google big breast problems.\r\n\r\nI haven't talked to my fiance about getting breast reduction surgery, although I will. He obviously loves how I look, particularly my breasts. He really loves them. \r\n\r\nI plan to eventually get surgery, and have talked to a surgeon to get information. I have been slowly thinking about it for years, and went to see the surgeon for a consultation the day before engagement and was going to talk to fiance. I floated a joke a year ago asking how he would feel \"if my boobs fell off\" and he was horrified. I'm not sure I want to wait 2 years. I have no idea how he will react if I say I want to do this, nor my sisters who often tell me how jealous they are of me. My friends are all jealous. My mother would be likely to flip out. I think that is partially religious, that I'd be messing up the wedding, and that I'm \"perfect the way I am.\"\r\n\r\nBasically am I an asshole for wanting to do this soon, and how do I have a conversation where I don't come out as the ass?\r\n\r\nEdit: Thank you everyone! The surgical consultation and engagement both only happened last week. I haven't talked with him yet because everyone is going crazy asking about the wedding, ring, planning, and apparently how many children we'll have. I can barely think straight with everything going on. Maybe I'm just scared what he will think, but I am definitely going to have surgery eventually. Maybe as people said below I should do it soon, before the wedding and see how it goes. I'll edit this once I have the conversation with him. My surgeon thinks it could go through medical insurance as a medical requirement, but that's TBD. It's important enough that I'll still get it done, as I have a very good job and would devote the money to this.

In essence our relationship has not been very smooth as there has been huge misunderstandings from other girls and guys who have tried to sabotage the relationship by spreading fake things but also there were instances were my boyfriend has flirted playfully as a friend to some girls which did not help the insecurity of it all. \r\n\r\nWe have met up already and actually been together but recently after that things have slightly changed where time difference and work schedules have come into play which results in less time to talk. Besides that, he just sleeps a lot. Im not bothered that he likes to play his games or he takes naps but sometimes i feel neglected where I\u2019m up late hours just to catch him to have a conversation and we don\u2019t even talk for 10 minutes and he tells me he needs a nap or something else to do. \r\n\r\nI tried having conversations about the feelings i have had about it and the backlash i get is that I\u2019m over reading the situations, that our relationship is no longer the \u201choneymoon\u201d stage and that our relationship doesn\u2019t require as much maintanence as before and also that I\u2019m always accusing him. I do try to also mention my faults, the bad history i have and that I\u2019m also trying to put forward my efforts to bring down my barriers to be more open but his responses half way through a convo is that he is \u201cdone\u201d talking about it. I even said we should work together to strengthen our relationship and we agreed on that but i said it feels like im the only one really trying while he gives me excuses and reasonings all the time. \r\n\r\nAll i asked him was that long distance relationship require effort and sometimes small details matter too like telling me he will be taking x amount of time to do this or that. For an instance, during thanksgiving he was video chatting with his family and while i was just finishing work he said it would be a while, so i responded \u201cokay, no problem, im home in an hour anyway\u201d and he said \u201cokay i will be at home when i come back\u201d. He replies to me intermittently and 2 hours after i came home he hasn\u2019t even responded to my last message so i told him im going to bed cause i can\u2019t wait anymore for his reply. He tells me yeah he will be hours more and i was mad because he didn\u2019t give me a heads up that his call would be more than 5 hours and i had been waiting that whole time to even get like 5?10? Minutes. I am not a person that would stop anyone from talking to their family especially on such a day but it definitely felt like total neglect of information. That is just one example but there are many more of the same thing. \r\n\r\nAnyway, tl;dr, am i an asshole? Like do i expect too much that even telling him how i feel about me, our relationship, about his behaviour, what could be fixed.

She is pregnant now with my kid, and the doctor told us to be careful. There are a lot of guidelines she has to follow, one of them is avoiding stress. \r\n\r\nI have been trying my best to cater to every one of her needs, help her through it and all that. She is making a little human being and all and she is full of hormones, I'm not taking any of the things she is saying to heart. \r\n\r\nThe other day though, we were talking and she brought up some stuff from my past. I had several issues with addiction and anger management in the past, but I have tried to move past it and be better since. It was pretty hurtful to hear her talk about it in the way she did, but I was powering through it. Again, hormones and all, not her fault. But then she said something she knew my abusive ex used to say to me, and I just couldn't take it.

She is a nurse, she kinda helped me through it and calmed down.

I responded claiming that I was under the impression that everyone was of age, as I was expecting my friend\u2019s 22 year old cousin. I told them that I specifically said Joe was welcome, but trusted my friend\u2019s judgement and assumed Tom was an adult as he looked older and we were going to go on a bar crawl, and that if my friend would have told me Tom was underage, I would not have let him come, and refused to give them my parent\u2019s contact info.

For the record, I don't vape at all. I'm fairly introverted, so I don't really care too much about the approval of being \"cool\" from my peers. The kids I do hang around with aren't into it either, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, today I went to the bathroom and saw six different kids taking turns with an e-cig of some kind. I was kind of fed up with people just loitering in the bathroom to vape, so I decided to discreetly notify the bathroom monitor (yes, we have those, and have to sign in and out of bathroom as well). As I was walking away, I heard the monitor ushering the six kids out of the bathroom, and I didn't hear the end of it because I was too far away at that point. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when I got back to lunch did I realize what might happen as a result of what I did. I might have just subjected 6 kids to the worst day of their lives, and for what? Will they quit vaping because they were caught, or are they just gonna continue but with more resentment for authority? It's likely that the bathrooms will be limited to 2-3 kids at a time as well, which sucks for the 95% of the school that doesn't vape.

I (20F) am originally from WA state, Seattle area, on the west side of the state. I lived there from 11-19. A year ago, I moved to the east side of the state to attend college. I thought that this was the best choice and option for me because I liked the school and they offered me more financial aid than any of my other school choices. I was mistaken, and I spent an entire school year taking freshman level classes being absolutely miserable, and my depression was getting worse throughout the year. During this time, my stepdad was looking for a new job within his company. There were multiple places throughout the country they could\u2019ve moved to, but they chose to move to Nashville, TN. Knowing I hated the school and town I was in, they asked me if I wanted to come with them, on the condition that I help out with my 3 year old brother and get a job before going back into school. My original plan was to only wait a quarter and save up some money to go to a local cc to finish my gen eds. That is not going to happen now, as I haven\u2019t saved much money from my part time job and am just now able to get my transcripts. This is also due to horrible depression that has left me unmotivated to get back into school and extremely unhappy (I\u2019m in therapy and just saw a psychiatrist today for medication management to get my mental health back on track). Here is my main issue: since moving to TN, my depression has gotten worse over time. My mom, stepdad, and I constantly argue, almost every single day over when I am going back to school. I work part time, usually 30-37 hours a week. They have now said that they will not continue to support me if I am just working a part time job and not actively trying to get back into school. My argument is that if I were in school and not working, it would be the same exact argument that they are still helping to support me financially. I should add that I do not drive. I have really bad driving anxiety, so they drive me everywhere or I take a lyft. I have my license and I know how to drive, I just choose not to. I pay them $200 in rent every month, and I pay for my cell phone. I eat the food they buy and sleep under their roof as a result. My mom and stepdad believe I take advantage of them because they drive me everywhere, and let me live with them for very low rent. My mom asked me a few weeks ago what my plan for school was. I said I didn\u2019t have one yet, and that she can\u2019t just expect me to have one at the drop of a hat. She said that 5 months is not the drop of a hat (I got out of school in June and was planning on going back in the fall), and that I need to have some kind of plan or she and my stepdad will force me to go back to Washington to live with my dad, or force me to move out.

About six years ago I decided I didn't want to be part of the family business anymore as it is completely unfulfilling for me. Not to mention, it's a dead end because my parents never acted like they wanted me to take it over. So I decided to go back to school, for culinary arts because cooking has always made me happy.\r\n\r\nOver most of the past six years I continued to work part time for my parents so that they could find someone for me to train to take my job over. About 4 years ago we found someone, I trained her, and I prepared to exit the company. Then my parents decided to pinch hit, and put someone else in my position and move the girl I had trained into another department entirely. At this point, I had my exit all worked out, I had a part time restaurant job of my dreams that I was trying to transfer to a full time position, and I ended up having to train someone new in a fraction of the time compared to the first time I trained someone. I still trained the second person to take my position, I moved to my full time cooking position and left the company.\r\n\r\nAfter I left, the first person I trained didn't last long in the new department and she quit. Then shortly after that, the second person I trained wasn't working out either. He had no real grasp on what he was supposed to be doing, and he made a lot of costly errors. After making several errors and costing my parents' company a ton of money he left, and they once again needed to fill my former position.\r\n\r\nWell, my dad found someone he liked, and even though I was working full time at a restaurant now, and it had been 2ish years since I had officially left the company, I came back to give the new guy a quick training session, and pray that it would all work out. Long story short, it didn't work out and the third person to take my old job left them after about a year. He gave them less than a week of actual notice and they didn't have any more tricks to get the job filled quickly.\r\n\r\nSo, last summer I quit my job to help my family out again. I told them that I would give them six months of my time, but that anymore would be detrimental to my kitchen career as I'm already a bit old to be a line dog, and I haven't been able to put the time into working my way up the ladder to a chef or management position. Now here we are, it is almost seven months after I left the restaurant, and I see no exit in sight. They can't hire anyone new for me to train, and all the things that I wanted to get away from the first time haven't changed.

During the summer time my husband's brother (21M) comes to stay, as he is attending college and is without housing for that time. His brother usually just sleeps in our guest room and leaves when summer is over. I (22F) attend college and work, while my husband works full time and pays most of the bills. His sister pays for nothing, as she's a kid and we both agree she should enjoy her childhood as long as financially possible. Funny enough, his brother pays just as much as his sister when he stays.\r\n\r\nThis is my main problem, his brother doesn't work, doesn't pay bills, and doesn't do ANY chores to help around the house. He just eats, plays his games, and showers (less than he should to be honest). On top if this, he and I are constantly bickering, mostly because he does nothing, while his brother works 12 hours a day, I work 8 and cook and do the dishes, but he can't be bothered to take the trash out. I have yet to properly call him out on it, but between that and his shitty attitude, I have a very small amount of patience with him anymore.

He's explained that even though he hates himself and is miserable, he somehow has a really high self esteem, and is an ass about it, so at least he knows, ish. I also feel like his brother should be the one to call him out, because despite me having a motherly role, I'm not related in any way to them and my husband has already assumed the leadership position. The problem is, he won't, he isn't home enough and when he is home, the last thing I'm sure he wants is to get in a giant fight with his brother before he leaves in 2 weeks. I know he leaves soon, but it just baffles me how he survives in other roommate situations, I mean Jesus Christ, how has this not already been addressed by his roommates?? \r\n\r\nSo.

Recently I decided to purchase a house due to a terrible slumlord who bought my apartment and was actively trying to force tennants out. \r\n\r\nWhen I told the GF she explicitly said that she does NOT want to be on the mortgage due to a past experience with a previous boyfriend that didnt work out well. She wanted to just pay rent to me and work it out that way. I said fine, but I warned her that when we both disagreed on something that has to do with the house that because she has \"no skin in the game\" aka no consequences she would ultimately not get the final say. \r\n\r\nFast forward to now. I purchased the house (totally in my name). The GF has been VERY adamant about choices that  are made in the house. For example, I wanted to paint rooms a certain color. The GF has an absolute fit about it (she wanted different colors) and I caved just to stop the argument so she got her colors. Any sort of furniture or decoration for the house I am not allowed to pick. \r\n\r\nSo the problem: I am in a 10 person fantasy football league. I am obligated to host ONE \"football sunday\" at my house this year. The GF wants me to cram 10 people into my small den room. This is not possible (well it is possible but it would be VERY uncomfortable for everyone). I told her that just isnt possible and we would need to host in the living room. She had a meltdown and then said that NOONE would be coming over for football sunday. I then informed her that while I do respect her opinion, there is no possible way she will be shutting down football sunday. \r\n\r\nI asked her why she wouldnt just hand out with all of my friends and watch football and I got no answer. \r\n\r\nAITA?"}, "964": {"id": "ehgdod", "title": "AITA if I (23M) think that my brother (11M) should close his bedroom door when he goes to sleep so that I don't get blamed every time when I wake him up with a small noise I make when going outside my room to the kitchen or to the bathroom at night?", "body": "My brother always sleeps with his door wide open. Now the problem for me is that my room is at one end of a short hall/alley and at the other end is my brother's room. This is on the ground floor of my parents apartment, the kitchen & the living room & my/my brothers bathroom is also on the ground floor (My parents rooms are on the 1st floor). Now what grinds my gears is that I'm basically confined to my own room from 9pm (when my brother goes to bed) to 8am (when my brother wakes up) because everything I do outside my own room wakes him up.\r\n\r\nSo what irks my ears is that I basically can't use the living room at all anymore and that I cannot be outside my own room as long as my brother is asleep, which fucking sucks, so I'm only allowed to leave my room to go to the bathroom or go quickly to the kitchen and get something to eat if absolutely necessary. I would just enjoy life a lot more if I could go on the balcony or lie down with a book in the living room at night even though my brothers asleep. But that's not possible, because if I am not super careful and make the slightest noise then my brother wakes up since he hears everything with his door open, immediately goes crying to my parents and blames me. Now I am not baking a pie while he's asleep, simply cutting some bread to make a sandwich or walking out of my own room to go take a good ol' fashioned shit can wake him up. I am not exaggerating, when my brother gets ready to go to bed my parents basically tell me this is my \"last chance\" to stock up on food & drinks before all light are out (when my brother goes to sleep he also \"sings\" his parrots in the living room to sleep and to not disturb the parrots nobody is allowed to put on a light outside their own rooms), so I'm heavily discouraged from leaving my own room at night.\r\n\r\nWell, why don't I just sleep at the same time as my brother? Well, I usually wake up at noon (not lazy, I get prescribed meds to fix my circadian rhythm, although they, as well as exercise/mediation/etc. don't seem to work that well to fix my sleep cycle) so I wish I could go to bed at the same time my brother goes to bed (c. 9pm) and wake up at 7am in the morning, but can't for medical reasons. So right now I'm kinda bound to waking up at noon and going to bed on 4am, meaning that 7 waking hours each day I am basically only allowed to be in my room.\r\n\r\nI'd just love a household where I could walk quietly in the apartment that I live in even when my brother's asleep (with his door closed so he wouldn't hear every single noise) outside my own room at night and that I could go in the living room at night and just lie on the sofas there, maybe read a book with a dim light on or something on my laptop or on the balcony to drink some tea. I don't know - am I being unreasonable?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I just don't get why my brother can always blame me for every sound I make at night when I tip-toe outside my room to get something to eat when he doesn't even close his own damn door."}, "965": {"id": "ahbnjq", "title": "WIBTA if I travel with my boyfriend even though my parents said no?", "body": "Oh GOD ok I have no idea what kind of reaction I\u2019m going to get. Sorry about the formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. And sorry if it\u2019s super long, I have some pent up frustration!\r\n\r\nSo here is some background: I am a 19F Asian-American college student. My family is Indian. My parents immigrated to America shortly before I was born. I have lived in the New England area my entire life. I\u2019ve been with my 19F boyfriend for almost 3 years (anniversary in April, yay!) and things are actually quite serious. We love each other a lot and have a plan for our future. My bf is actually not originally from the New England area, but from Georgia. He asked me to travel to Georgia for our week long spring break in March (we go to the same college) with him and his parents to meet the rest of his family. I really want to go, but here is the issue. \r\n\r\nMy parents 100% disapprove of me traveling with a boyfriend. My mom\u2019s exact words are: \u201cOnly trashy girls travel with their boyfriends.\u201d Every time I hear that I roll my eyes as hard as I can. My parents  grew up in India in the 80\u2019s, so I know it\u2019s a cultural issue. But that statement upsets me because so many people I know travel with their boyfriends. Here are some other reasons they have given for not wanting me to go on the trip, kind of jumbled up into one paragraph:\r\n\r\nI am too young to be in such a serious relationship. They are uncomfortable with how serious the relationship is. They don\u2019t want me to travel with my boyfriend. What would their friends and family think of them? They think if I spend my spring break on vacation it means I am not focused on my studies. I am not an adult in their eyes and they can\u2019t trust me (with what exactly I\u2019m not sure). \r\n\r\nI want to say that I\u2019m not an entitled kid. I\u2019m simply not. I think about my parents\u2019 feelings a lot before I ask to go anywhere or do anything. Up until a couple of weeks ago, my curfew was 9:30 pm, and my parents were slowly decreasing it to 9 pm, then 8:30. I finally negotiated 11:30, which I think is completely fair (NOTE: I don\u2019t come home at 11:30 every night! I come home more around 9:30 or 10 anyway so that THEY can feel better about me being outside the house and so I can demonstrate that I am a responsible and conscientious person like I tell them I am. 11:30 is the time I absolutely have to be home, no matter what). I do what they ask and I always put their feelings first. If they are not comfortable with me going to a bar, for example, even if I promise not to drink, I just won\u2019t go\u2014even though I am 19 and could get into some of the bars in my home town. I do a lot to appease them because they are my parents, and I love them and respect their wishes. \r\n\r\nOn this issue, I feel they are wrong. It would be a 5 day trip with my bf\u2019s PARENTS. We\u2019d be staying at his grandma\u2019s house in separate rooms. I understand their discomfort as parents. I really do. This is new territory for them and I get that. But I feel that their reasoning is flawed, and this has been one of the only times I have questioned their verdict. My reasons for wanting to go are simple: I\u2019ve never been to Georgia; I want to meet my boyfriend\u2019s family; and my next opportunity to go won\u2019t be for years as my bf and I are both pre-med and want to spend the rest of our semesters focusing 100% on studies. My parents a) do not believe that I want to go to Georgia for myself (they think I only want to go to please my boyfriend...) and b) think for some reason that my studies/ focus on my studies will be greatly impacted by this trip. It\u2019s a vacation like any other. Would my studies be impacted if they brought me on a week long trip? Only as much as if I went on the trip to Georgia!\r\n\r\nI plan on trying to get their blessing to go one more time, but if it doesn\u2019t work, I plan on just giving them the heads up and going anyway. I know if I do this I will never hear the end of it for the rest of my life, so I am scared. But I am 19. I spend 5 days a week at school, and I study for the MCAT 5-6 hours every day WHILE studying for my other classes! I also manage to make time for clubs, the gym, and my lovely boyfriend. I would love to get this vacation in while I am still able to. I have tried giving in and telling my bf I can\u2019t go, but he knows I really want to and is encouraging me to stand up for myself. My parents view him as very mature and wise beyond his years (which he is), so I am going to include him in my last plea when I sit to talk with my parents. Hopefully he can reassure them that it\u2019s not as big a deal as they think it is. \r\n\r\nNote: my parent\u2019s \u201cblessing\u201d/ permission to go is important to me because I seek their approval and I don\u2019t want them to be mad at me about this. I can\u2019t quite explain it, but I know Asian-American children of immigrants will definitely understand. I know plenty of other people understand as well lol, but all my Indian friends have similar relationships with their parents and similar expectations placed upon them, so I listed Asian-American children of immigrants for reference only!\r\n\r\nOther very important note: I am paying for my expenses myself! I have a job. I will pay for my plane ticket, food, activities, everything. They are not contributing money for this trip. \r\n\r\nSo reddit, if I go to Georgia with my boyfriend after my parents say no (if they say no), WIBTA? I will be consulting r/relationships again as well to prepare myself for any fallout from this (unless, of course, I and up being the asshole).

I recognize i didnt confront that former friend properly, so i took some time to figure out how to confront the other. \r\n\r\nI usually dont confront this friend either because every time i do, he talks about how bad of a person he is and throws a tantrum, and sometimes he blocks me. But i dont want to go into the new year walking on eggshells with him anymore. Like for example, a couple months ago, he accused me of being the worst person ever for things that never happened, and then admitted he made it up, and during that time, he had me blocked. We had a really hard time talking about that incident because i kept having to reword things in order to not hurt his feelings and assume the responsibility for what happened despite him saying that it was made up.\r\n\r\nSo i let him know that there were some things he was doing that really bothered me, and i asked him for a break from the friendship. He got me in trouble at work one night because he thinks dialing extensions is hilarious, does it constantly, and i ended up mistaking a few important calls for him dicking around.

Hes vague posting about me right now, and saying things like he understands why i havent said anything when im upset knowing how badly he reacts, but then a few posts later, says our friendship was fake because im emotionally dishonest.

My partner (33F) also likes anime, so we often watch it together. Now, the important thing to know about bad anime for the purposes of this post is that it usually involves fanservice.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nFanservice is where the author puts their characters in costumes, poses, and situations that sexualize them. Classic example: a man trips and falls onto a woman. They fall to the floor, and the man ends up \u201caccidentally\u201d groping the woman\u2019s boobs, which are practically falling out of her outfit.  \r\n\r\nMy partner and I are uncomfortable with fanservice. My coping strategy is to ignore it. My partner\u2019s is apparently to constantly point it out.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAt first, I was happy to\u00a0validate her feelings. This was not hard, since I do agree with her completely, but eventually\u00a0I started to get tired of it. Since I\u00a0try to enjoy anime by ignoring fanservice, having someone constantly point it out kind of detracts from my enjoyment. After a while, I just\u00a0stopped responding as much, hoping she would run out of steam.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe did not run out of steam.\u00a0If anything, it got worse. This went on for a couple years. I feel like in habitually focusing on fanservice, she became extra sensitive to it. The last straw for me was an emotional flashback about some character\u2019s dead parents or something, and she shouts \u201cBOOBS!\u201d in my ear because a woman\u2019s chest was visible in the shot. Granted, said character is in a top that wouldn\u2019t realistically even hold her boobs in, but there is otherwise nothing sexual about the scene. She\u2019ll go on about it too, just talking over the dialog about boobs or whatever while I\u2019m trying to watch the damn show.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nSo I asked her to stop, and told her why in much the same way that I wrote it up here. She says she can\u2019t just ignore it. She got groped on the train while she was in Japan, so she feels that she has something of a personal stake in opposing the way that anime encourages young Japanese boys to view women as sex objects. I guess she feels like ignoring it is giving it a pass? I told her that I agree with her, so she\u2019s really just preaching to the choir. As I\u2019m writing it out now, I guess I realize that she\u2019s basically just venting, but I still just don\u2019t want to hear it anymore. She doesn\u2019t understand why.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nI tried to explain it to her with the following analogy:\u00a0 \r\n\r\nImagine we both enjoy seeing plays at this theatre. We both enjoy their productions, but their sets and props are kind of cheap and shabby. She tries to ignore it, but I have to point it out every time I see it. Talking over dialog to complain about how poorly painted the background is. Pointing it out every time the costumes aren\u2019t period-accurate, etc. For years. Every time we see a play, throughout the show. \r\n\r\nShe says she would still want to hear what I have to say.

WIBTA if I finally snapped and told him how he's useless, inconsiderate, and a shit friend? \r\n\r\nThis is long so apologies, I tried to make sure it's not a wall of text but I'm on mobile so may have some issues. \r\n\r\nI haven't spoken to my housemate (let's call him L) in a week. \r\n\r\nA background story: We're both second years in university and have lived together (along with 2 other girls - both 19 - and another guy - 20) for the entire 2 years we've been at uni together.\r\n\r\nNow L has always been pretty inconsiderate as a housemate, he doesn't clean up after himself AT ALL, dirty plates and cutlery of his will be on the kitchen side for 2+ weeks before he eventually either washes it himself, or someone else gives in and they'll wash it, he makes messes over the hobs and sides whilst he cooks and won't clean it up, he frequently will just leave his rubbish on the side and someone else will have to put it in the bin. I'm not going to act like the rest of us don't all do these things sometimes, of course we do, we're students and 4/5 of us also work part-time so of course between uni work and our jobs somethings are going to slack sometimes, but he just never does anything. (L used to work weekends at a national park but they don't need him over the winter, so he hasn't worked since the beginning of November and won't work again until March - he also spent all his overdraft going travelling over the summer and spent most of his student loan on take out food and weed)\r\n\r\nLast year we lived in a flat (same 5 of us, plus a 3rd year - 21M - and another guy in our year) and, aside from making a few flat meals - think maybe 10 in a year - L treated the rest of us like maids, this was particularly the case for me (B), our housemate M, and our housemate R. The kitchen would get absolutely horrific before it would be cleaned, with the vast majority of this mess coming from L, and L helped with this maybe twice. Once I wasn't even in the flat for a weekend, I had gone to visit my bestfriend at her uni over 150 miles away for three days and when I returned R and M (with very little help from L) were cleaning the kitchen, so of course the first thing I did was begin to help. A separate time it took R and I (M was at work) 3.5 hours to fully deep clean the kitchen with absolutely no help from L (he was locked in his room the entire time, came in twice for food and completely ignored us cleaning).\r\n\r\nOver Christmas last year all of us went home for a little bit, and before leaving we all made sure the kitchen was clean and our own things were clean because we didn't want to come back to the kitchen being horrible and mouldy food. L was the last to leave and first to come back, in total he only went home for maybe 4 days, whilst the rest of us were home for a week or two. So aside from L, I was the first to return to the flat and since I live over 200 miles from the university I attend, my mum was the one who picked me up and drove me there again. So my mum and I walk into the flat, and the first door leads to the kitchen, so after putting my bags in my room we both went in the kitchen to make some drinks, boy was that a mistake. The entire kitchen was disgusting, the floors were sticky and covered with crumbs and small pieces of food, the bins were full and overflowing with rubbish all on the floor (not in bin bags, just on the floor) there were dirty plates on the side and a glass casserole dish that had dried up pasta bake inside that was growing mould, the sinks were both full of plates and one also was full of water, neither of us could work out how long the water had been there considering it was grey, opaque, and had mould growing on it. My mum and I were both disgusted and spent hours cleaning the kitchen before we could go and get a food shop for me. This entire time L stayed locked in his room and didn't answer the door or even make a sound if either of us knocked/called through the door. I know for a fact he was in there though because 6 or so hours later he came out. When I went home for two weeks over Easter, my mum and I returned to almost the exact same situation where L hadn't gone home, except this time it was in 25\u00b0C heat in a kitchen that had an entire wall that was windows, so the entire kitchen smelt like hot rotting garbage.\r\n\r\nSo after all of this, when we moved into a house at the beginning of second year, we made some rules which included each housemate having a particular job (singular if it was a big thing, plural if they were smaller jobs) and Ls only job was to be cleaning the bathroom. We share one bathroom between 5 of us, so obviously this is a job that needs to be done once a week to once a fortnight (if it's not too bad and L has some assignments), and this cleaning of the bathroom involves mopping/sweeping the floors, cleaning the sink, the side, the toilet, emptying the bin, and cleaning the bath/shower. We have been living in this house since August and L has cleaned the bathroom approximately 4 times. If any of us ask, he will brush it off and say he'll do it later, snap at us to fuck off, or completely ignore us. He still makes a load of mess in the kitchen, and won't wash his plates and things up, he also smokes cigs and weed in his room which in turn makes the hallway stink and then gets arsey if M and I complain about it because we don't like the smell of either (neither of us have any problem with him smoking, so long as he does it outside).\r\n\r\nSo, after all that, let's get to the main crux of the story (again, apologies for the length, I'm just fuming and am ranting). Our house is a student house, and therefore comes with all the \"quirks\" a student house comes with, including walls highly susceptible to mould/condensation, some questionably working appliances, even more questionable landlords/renting agencies, absolutely no insulation, and a speciality of the area we go to university in, this happens in private houses and everything too, a minor slug infestation. We've salted and everything and haven't had a slug issue since September, don't worry. But yeah, our heating isn't the best, and until yesterday the lounge radiator wasn't working which meant with no insulation the lounge was an unliveable temperature, with the rest of the house not being much warmer. We don't have a tumble dryer, only clothes airers and since our house is cold most of the time our clothes take forever to dry.\r\n\r\nNow M and L did a load of laundry each, and then both hung it up on two airers in our bathroom, and left it there to dry. A day or so later, I also did a load of laundry (without realising theirs was on the airers), I was considerate about this and wanted their clothes to dry and so I left my wet laundry in a basket in the bathroom to be hung up. A week later, their clothes were finally dry, except since mine had been wet and not hung out for a week they smelt damp and horrible, so I took M and Ls clothes off the airers and up to their rooms, before rewashing my clothes and hanging them out. I used both airers doing this, which I realise is a bit annoying, but I had waited 3 weeks by this point to do a load of laundry because everytime I said I was going to do one, someone else needed one more (think dirty work clothes and no clean ones, etc.) and besides both of these airers actually belong to me anyway. Less than two full days later, L took all of my clothes off the airers in front of M. M asked him whether they were dry, knowing they hadn't been there very long and he said \"yes\" as well as telling me they were dry, so he took them up to my room in a bag and left them there.\r\n\r\nSince I had 2 large assignments due in and a test that week, I left my clothes in the bag in my room for 4 or 5 days, until I had the time to be able to put them away, because I was trusting that L was honest when he said they were dry. That finally brings us to last Thursday, where I had the time to put my clothes away and began to do so, only to find out that the 3 pieces of clothing on top were the only dry clothes in the entire bag. All the rest of the clothes were still completely soaked through and, of course, smelt terrible because of how long they had been sat there. \r\n\r\nI messaged the house groupchat giving L a piece of my mind and telling him how inconsiderate and how big of a dick he was for taking my clothes off the airer when I had left his and Ms on there for over a week and had already had to rewash this load of clothes because of that, and now had to rewash the load again. I'm furious at L for being so inconsiderate and rude and lying to both M and I about my clothes being dry. He read every message and ignored them all, didn't apologise over message or face to face, and avoided me from last Thursday until this Wednesday. \r\n\r\nWhen he saw me on Wednesday he said hi and acted like nothing had happened. I ignored him. M also was ignoring him Wednesday - Wednesday for a different reason, however spoke to him yesterday and then told me that when her and R (my boyfriend) had brought up my laundry L had said \"oh thats why she's ignoring me\" and then acted like he hadn't done anything wrong, so M doesn't think I'll get an apology. \r\n\r\nI'm furious because that is the final incident that shows just how little respect he has for me as a person, and despite the fact that he is disgusting this entire time I have been considering him a friend. He's treated me like a maid (worse than that to be honest, at least they get paid) for a year and a half, and has continuously shown the absolute lack of respect he has for all of us, but particularly M and I, and this is the final straw for me. Whilst not talking to him he had left all of his dirty plates and things on the side for 10+ days again, so I had finally had enough and put all of them back in his cupboard whilst still dirty. He found out the other day, took everything out and left it on the side for 2 days again before washing it, then asked M and R who put it in there and R told him it was me. L then started bitching that it had only been there \"2 days\" before M shut it down. \r\n\r\nSo I guess, with all this info taken into account, AITA if I continue to not acknowledge or talk to my housemate, and continue putting his dirty dishes that have been left out for ages in his cupboard, either indefinitely or until I get a sincere apology? WIBTA if I finally end up snapping at him about how he's inconsiderate, useless, and a shit friend? \r\n\r\n"}, "973": {"id": "etbd50", "title": "AITA For buying a book when I'm having money issues?", "body": "My (33f) boyfriend (35m) is quite angry at me at the moment, as is my mother.\r\n\r\nSince November, my job has cut my hours temporarily (normally I work 38-40 a week, now it's more like 25-28).\r\n\r\nI should make a note, I do NOT live with my boyfriend, and our finances are not shared. Since we started dating, we have split date costs, taking turns treating the other person.\r\n\r\nMy mother lives 20mins away and I live downtown in a shared apartment with my roommate.

I came in anyways worked about 3 hours, then I left, and went to a local bookstore. While I was there, I found a book based on a show I watched that I didn't realize was a book! It was 12.99, and I still have \\~8 dollars on a gift card. I bought it, then settled in a chair and read for a little while before taking my purchase home.

However, my bills are all still being paid, and I'm not dipping into savings. It's just that my spending money is practically non-existent (I'd say total I have about 20-40$ at the end of each paycheck after bills). The last few months, when it's my turn for date night, I've been cooking for us, and we do game nights/movie nights etc. Well my boyfriend saw the book on the counter when he came over last night, and the receipt and asked me why I bought it when I'm broke. He got upset with me and started saying things about how irresponsible I am with money, and it's reason's like this that I'm always low on funds. I stated, that I'm hardly an over spender, and the reason I'm low on funds are my hours getting cut. He brought up about how I never take him out anymore, and that he feels like he can't say anything because he knows I'm dealing with work stuff, but now he's not so sure he buys that anymore if I can \"waste money\" like that. It turned into a pretty nasty fight.\r\n\r\nI talked to my mom, and she agreed with him. That I'm being selfish spending money on myself instead of saving my money. She brought up how she always has to pay for dinners on Sunday. I again, pointed out, she pays for the food but I go and get the food and bring it over using my car, and my gas so that she doesn't have to leave the house. I also never insist on being taken out, or paid for either. SHE invites me over, and HE chooses what we do on his date nights.

I have tried numerous times to explain to her, that working/saving is not as easy as it was for her, and that she does NOT have to spend money on dinner for me if she doesn't want to. My retort was, yes she pays for my dinner, but I still help by picking it up and bringing it to her so she doesn't have to go out. (she doesn't like to go to restaurants because of tipping). I'll admit I definetly over reacted when talking to my mom, which is why she is still upset because in her eyes \"she's just helping\"\r\n\r\n\\-I don't know what's up with the boyfriend, but based on the comments, I'm thinking it maybe has something to do with him knowing how frugal I am, and how I DO complain about the current situation.\r\n\r\n\\-I was told to add: The benefits at my job are the reason I stay, they are excellent, and also, I am NOT at risk of being let go, neither is anyone else.

They are both great people (both 30yo) and I (18F) loved having Mitch in my family, and we (as a family) visited each other regularly. About 3 years ago, when the breakup happened, I was not aware of why it happened or how bad it was, because no one was willing to tell me. I simply assumed whatever happened with them wasn't so bad and that they had just decided to go their separate ways.\r\n\r\nAbout 1 year ago I went to get my first tattoo and it was obvious I was going to pick his studio, because I've always adored his work and because he draws in a style I like. He charged me the minimum price for a small/medium-sized tattoo and I was super happy with how he did. I showed it to my aunt a few days after it had finished healing and she was happy I got it done but also very disappointed in me. She said that it wasn't okay for me to have gone to his studio because of their past relationship and that even her friends have not gone to get tattooed by Mitch because of how horrible their break up was because he started a new relationship right after ending one with Jen (judging from this and other small clues, she and other friends assumed he was cheating). I explained I didn't know what happened between them and didn't think much of it at the time. She said it was alright since I didn't know, but that picking him next time wouldn't be okay and that there are plenty of other good tattoo artists that match him.\r\n\r\nIt's been 1 year since I got my first tattoo and I'm planning to get the next one on my upcoming birthday. The issue is, I've looked at the tattoo artists Jen mentioned and more, but honestly have not found one anywhere near me that matches Mitch's style or professionalism. I think picking the right tattoo artist for you is a very important step that takes a lot of patience and time, that's why Mitch is, again, my pick and I know I'm making a selfish decision of picking him again when they've very sternly asked me not to, but I also think Jen's expectation for her friends and family to not pick a very talented tattoo artist for his services (not even for a friendship or relationship, but something he does to earn his living) just because of their own common history is a way more selfish action.

My cousin and I (21F) were left out of many details throughout these deaths. I didn\u2019t know my uncle was sick and in the hospital until after he died. My grandpa was in the hospital and I was told he had 48 hours to live by my dad, so I made the hour and a half drive up the next day to visit him one last time.

I told my stepmom I called my cousin on the way up, and she replied immediately \u201cWhy would you do that?! He didn\u2019t need to know, and you shouldn\u2019t have brought it up.\u201d Because of these issues, he and I made a pact to each other to always tell one another everything, since no one else in the family will do it for us. \r\n\r\nYesterday, I received a call from my grandma that she and my uncle\u2019s wife will be throwing a family and close friend BBQ/memorial in two weeks for my uncle since we\u2019ve reached the one-year mark.

Not always with his wallet, but always one of his possessions. Before it's been his weed that he had misplaced and left in a hotel room. It was returned to him when found. His lighter, his keys, etc etc etc. And it always goes the same way. He \"loses\" something or something was \"stolen,\" he has a panic attack, he finds it, life moves on. \r\n\r\nUsually I'll grin and bear it, and look around until he finds whatever he was missing, but on my wedding night I was NOT having it, which is why I feel like an asshole. After about 10 -15 minutes of searching around, I abandoned the cause and went back to enjoying my night. When he started saying that someone must have stolen it, I felt as though he crossed a line. The only people at my wedding were my very close friends and my close family. \r\n\r\nHe approached me a few more times before storming out, and I acknowledged him with \"that's so weird!\" and \"I'm sorry; I'm sure it'll turn up!\" but didn't offer to help any more. Later that night, around 12am, he called my cell phone several times and I let it go to voice mail, because I was Very busy. He didn't attempt to reach out after that, at all.\r\n\r\nZ was a good friend, and I feel as though I may have dropped the ball on helping him with his wallet, but I feel as though he was a huge asshole for accusing my family of stealing, and I don't think it should be on me to make ammends.

Over that time, we've become pretty inseparable at work. Lunches and breaks together, swinging by each others' work space to see how their day is going, etc. A lot of our friendship is based on helping each other out and supporting each other in our endeavors. When people transfer from other departments or stores, they always assume or are curious if we're going out. I get asked if we are probably once a month. \r\n\r\nLike i said, my coworker is married. However, I didn't even realize she was married until after a year of knowing her. Let me explain. Now, because of the nature of where we work (power tools, machinery, that sort of thing), it's not uncommon for people to not wear their wedding rings for fear of getting them caught in something or damaged. I've never seen her wear her wedding ring to work. Again, not uncommon; about half the married people there have never worn their wedding rings at work. \r\n\r\nHowever, she almost never talks about being married. The first time I heard her mention it was over a year after knowing her (she replied to a direct question; she didn't bring it up). The other two coworkers that were there both expressed surprise at hearing she was married, so I know I wasn't just being obtuse.  I've only heard her reference it like twice after that, both times after direct questions. \r\n\r\nNow for me, it takes me a really long time to even like someone, and it's not easy for me to just stop liking someone. But, after hearing she was married, I figured I should probably shove those feelings down and try to move on. I've had friendships before where I've had unrequited interest, and I've managed to slowly work my interest down and maintain those close friendships. So I decided to keep the same level of friendship while dealing with my feelings myself. \r\n\r\nTwo or three months ago, I heard she was getting a divorce from two diffferent mutual friends. Some of the topics we've been discussing support this (switching over to the company healthcare, etc). I'm not saying that it's because of this, but the amount of time we hang out outside of work recently has increased. Before, it was more of group things or doing work related stuff outside of work (like helping her prep for an interview), but it's been turning into grabbing coffee before work semi-regularly and hanging out longer and talking after work even more than before. We've also been texting quite a bit more. We haven't done anything questionable (kissing, etc). \r\n\r\nI kind of feel like I might be the asshole, especially if her divorce has something to do with me. At the same time, I have opposite-sex friendships that I have a similar closeness to (maybe not as much day to day interaction), so I feel like maybe I'm not an asshole and just being a good friend?

He was out in her car for almost three hours, and came back in and immediately kissed his wife, and took her out to the car to go home, after blowing a kiss back through the door at my friend that he had cheated with. Once again, this is all stuff I was told by MULTIPLE people and not from my own memory. As soon as I heard this, I called my friend to tell her, and the sound of heartbreak in her voice absolutely killed me. I called my other friend (the one he cheated with) and she proceeded to apologize profusely and said she had no idea how it would affect their marriage. Flash forward to a couple weeks, I was hanging out with some friends at a bar when she walked in (invited by one of my friends in the group) and joined us. I took a picture with her and posted it to my story and thought nothing more of it. I then got a veryyyy long text message two days later saying how disrespectful it was for me to hang out with her because they were trying to work through this very tough moment and I had to remind her all over again what happened. I proceeded to tell her the whole story from that night, instead of just telling her that her husband slept with someone else, because I frankly only blame him. I didn\u2019t want to lose a good friend over the fact that her husband manipulated my other friend into getting what he wanted. She responded with another hurtful text message about how I know him and I know that he would never try to do something like that and she couldn\u2019t believe that I would trust strangers over a friend. Once again I defended my friend and told her that the blame was on her husband, and even if I would respect her decision to stay with him, I was never going to forgive him and I definitely wasn\u2019t going to lose a good friend over his bad decisions. In the end, she decided to cut me off after 9 years of being best friends because I didn\u2019t trust her husband, and even texted our other really good friend from Utah urging her to cut me off as well... AITA here because I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong?\r\n\r\nPs..

I\u2019m adopted which doesn\u2019t hold much emotional weight on me because I love my mum more than anything and I don\u2019t mind being adopted. My mum didn\u2019t come with my partner and I on this extended part of the trip because she\u2019s not in the position to travel loads, so my aunt joined instead. \r\n\r\nFrom the off she was very demanding and rude at the airport due to delays in flights. Understandable, my partner and I didn\u2019t question it. We go on to the topic about comfort animals that were allowed to be flights (she\u2019s a flight attendant, so she\u2019s seen it all). She made a very rude remark about how I couldn\u2019t call my cat a comfort animal. I didn\u2019t bring my cat on this trip because my partner was with me, but I had originally gotten my feline companion to cope with a hard time in my life and finding out my mother was sick.

And when I say \"identical\", the only difference between these two dresses is that hers is in ivory and mine is in cream. And she made this switch *after* I picked out mine and she came with me to the store to help me pick, so she didn't just know I'd chosen that dress, she helped me choose it.\r\n\r\nHer wedding is a month before mine. Hers is in November, while mine is in December. We both still have time to change stuff around, and were told as long as we made the choices before we got to the 1 month countdown, it would be fine, and after the countdown it was still possible, just trickier.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI told my sister that I'm fine with the centrepieces, venue, caterer and menu being exactly the same, and I am willing to change my cake so she can keep hers as it is. I'll even change the colour scheme and let my sister have navy and change mine to a dark red or something. But she has to change *something*. She hasn't had the dress tailored yet and I have, so she can easily return or exchange it. If she can't or doesn't want to then change the cake, as she has time. Or the colour scheme or the flowers, as she has time to change those, too. But give me something from my wedding so I don't look like I'm copying her.\r\n\r\nSis says I'm being a bitch, I don't own or have a claim to any of these things. The cake comes from a bakery we loved when we were kids, the venue is one of the nicer wedding spots in town, the caterer, flowers, centrepiece are all decided, and after seeing the dress on me she wanted to see how it would look on her and loved it as much as I did. She argues that as my wedding is a month after hers, I am the one who should change things as I have more time. She also says that the closer we are to the deadline, the more expensive it will be to change things, so while I can still switch stuff around for free, she will have to at the very least pay a fee to change things and it's unreasonable of me to expect her to alter her wedding.\r\n\r\nMy father is on her side due to the timing and a few well timed tears from Sis, and my brother says she's not going to back down and it would be easier on everyone to just let her have this.\r\n\r\nDad is ill, not severely, but he's had a few health scares, has high blood pressure, and he can't deal with any upset in the family.

On our first date I made a joke about how she \"couldn't get gayer\" and she gave me a bouquet of rainbow roses (they're made by splitting the stem and putting each part of the stem in a different colour dye) so for our wedding (with some advice from the florist) we went for bouquets of white roses with a single rainbow rose in the middle, and the buttonholes are white roses for everyone but my future wife, who has a rainbow rose. My sister, who doesn't even like roses and her groom, who is a raging homophobe, have no attachment to these flowers, but they are having these exact flowers for their wedding.

The friend I'm mentioning will be called \"Mary\" (31f).  My wife has had a group of friends since we met that are a mix of childhood friends, college friends, and friends of friends.  There are maybe six of them and they get together for monthly book clubs and stuff like that.  Since meeting me, however, she's integrated with my friends and hangs out with them on a regular basis without me.  Conversely, I never hang out with her friends unless I really have to.  \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThis context is important because I generally dislike her friends because they are objectively catty, judgmental, and extremely gossipy.  To keep this post somewhat short, I'll just give a couple of examples:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n1.  When planning our wedding, my wife got into a fight with Mary because we had strongly considered Memorial Day weekend because it was one of only two available weekends for our chosen venue.  Mary called her crying saying that she would be 7 months pregnant at that time and couldn't understand how we could do that to her.\r\n2. When my wife chose to have her bachelorette party out of town in Texas, Mary called her to tell her that she would \"try\" to make it, but if she couldn't go out of state, Mary wanted to throw her a separate party in our home town.  My wife specifically said she didn't want to do that, but ended up caving and having two parties.  In contrast, none of the book club girls went to Texas - three of the friends she met through went with her to Texas.\r\n3. When Mary got pregnant with her first kid, my wife and her were constantly fighting about how Mary kept breaking promises and changed their routines because of \"baby on the way\".  This conflict never really resolved itself, but when I asked Mary about it, she said \"well you will understand when you have kids\" despite the fact that she  knows that we don't want kids.\r\n4. The book club girls all live in the suburbs.  We live in the city in a really nice, fun neighborhood.  They came over for book club one night a few months ago and thought I couldn't hear them.  While in the other room, I heard them talk about how they could never live in \"the ghetto\" like us in such a small house.  For the record, we just remodeled out entire house this past year and will have it paid off in 4 years.\r\n5. We went out to a football game one night and on the way back, decided to stop at one of my favorite bars from grad school  Mary tells us that she wants to leave before we even order a beer because the neighborhood is \"pretty diverse\".  Take that to mean what you think.\r\n\r\nAnd that basically brings us up to the event in question.  There are a lot of other similar incidents like what I described above that are either judgmental or even bordering on racism in some cases, but about two weeks ago one of the girls broke up with her long-time boyfriend.  At their monthly book club meeting, this girl was silent on the reasoning and just didn't want to talk about it.  My wife comes home from book club a little tipsy and starts talking about how she found out the real reason they broke up:  the girl cheated on the guy and couldn't stand the shame.  I basically told her that that story sounds like gossip and that unless you heard it from the source, just be a supportive friend and try to help her friend mourn the loss of the relationship.\r\n\r\nWell this past week, we found out that the break up was for a completely unrelated reason and my wife admitted that the cheating story originated with Mary.  Yesterday at my wife's birthday party after everyone else left, I straight up told Mary that being loyal to the absent is one of the best ways to support your friends, that I heard about the cheating allegation and that her and my wife should show more empathy for a friend going through a break up.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy wife comes back today and tells me that apparently I really hurt Mary's feelings and that I was way too blunt with her.  She also said that everything she told me about the cheating allegation was told to me in confidence and that I shouldn't have mentioned it since it wasn't my place.  I know I was blunt, but I think that spreading lies and judging people is something that shouldn't be tolerated at all.  In this case, it was so abundantly clear that the allegations were made up and it should be an easy point for her to introspectively say \"Yeah, that was kind of a dick move on my part.  Maybe I shouldn't have said that stuff\".  Now my wife wants me to apologize and Mary isn't answering my calls.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole here?  I frankly wouldn't care if I never saw any of these friends again, but my wife likes them and I don't want to make her sad."}, "1004": {"id": "ewy4dk", "title": "WIBTA If I sent my ex best friend a text telling her to leave my kid alone?", "body": "So I (25F) was best friends with this girl, Sarah, since 8th grade. I got pregnant pretty young and we stayed friends throughout this, however three weeks after I had my daughter she sent me a long text telling me we couldn\u2019t be friends anymore because I hardly talked to her anymore and I treated her problems as if they weren\u2019t important. (I had PPD and also found out my bf at the time was cheating, she knew this, meanwhile her sister stole her favorite shirt or something). \r\nAnyways, when my daughter was about 3 she reached out and apologized and we became friends again. That lasted about a year. Last year she decided to plan a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend on MY birthday. His birthday is like 2 weeks BEFORE mine. I sent her a text saying I couldn\u2019t go because it was my birthday and I had plans, she replied with something kind of passive aggressive and I just didn\u2019t reply because I was slightly annoyed but also busy at the time. A week later I texted her about something unrelated and she replied with a long text saying that because I ignored her (again a week), that she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend and that her boyfriends party was planned before my plans so I should have at least made an appearance because she thought we were friends and that\u2019s what friends do and that she didn\u2019t even remember it was my birthday when she planned it on that day so I shouldn\u2019t have left her on read for a whole week over something so silly (according to her). \r\nCut to now, I haven\u2019t talked to her since that day and she just got a job as a teaching assistant at my daughters school. She doesn\u2019t work in her classroom but I found out from her teacher and my daughter that she comes and visits her quite often. Today my daughter came home with a necklace and a picture of her and Sarah from when she was a baby that Sarah gave her, and was asking me when we can all hang out again. I knew Sarah had gotten a job there and I knew that she saw my daughter here and there, but I didn\u2019t realize that she was going to her class everyday and giving her photos and acting like we were still friends. Her teacher told me that she told her we were best friends and the teacher didn\u2019t question it because my daughter knew her. But after she came home with that picture I was extremely angry for some reason and don\u2019t want her hanging around my daughter anymore after she told me she wanted nothing to do with me for not texting her for a week.

This has been happening for a while now and I\u2019ve read books and tried to be understanding that my boyfriend should be able to do what makes him happy and if it\u2019s not a huge deal then I should just let things be... and that I can\u2019t expect my SO to do the same things that I\u2019m willing to do for him.\r\n\r\nIt just really hurts my feelings that after a week or two of us being apart, he will constantly say how much he misses me, and I will say the same back but when I am finally home the first night and want nothing more than to see him, he stays out absurdly long at his work party (like 3-4 am). I totally get that if there is a work party he should be there to network and have fun, but I can\u2019t help feeling that in the reverse situation, I\u2019d go to the work event but leave slightly earlier (like maybe 9-10pm) to be able to spend some quality time with him after not seeing him for so long. I especially wouldn\u2019t have the mood to go clubbing when my SO is at home waiting to see me. I don\u2019t have any suspicions on cheating or anything.. it just hurts my feelings somehow.\r\n\r\nI got really upset at this in the past... I\u2019m not sure where this low feeling comes from but each time it happens I get to the point question whether I want to be with him long term. Maybe it\u2019s the imbalance I feel? Am I just being a baby? I\u2019m debating whether I should calmly talk to him that him going out late the night when I\u2019m back from a long trip hurts my feelings... but I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll turn into an argument. Im thinking I should probably say it anyway and see how he reacts since it bugs me so much.\r\n\r\nI feel how I\u2019ve been dealing with it is I just try to ignore it- we don\u2019t get into fights about it but to be honest I don\u2019t feel as crazy about him as I did in the past.. maybe this belongs in relationship advice lol"}}
