I don't have an instagram just for personal reasons however my other female friend does. I told her his name because I was telling her about him and she wanted to see what he looked like.

As to not raise suspicion the message went something like \"you guys are such a cute couple, I've always wanted to go to \\*city\\*!\" just a simple message.

I have a bad habit of jumping into a new relationship immediately after one ends. I've been in relationships since I was 17, minus one month when I was 20. My last relationship ended because my ex and I became more like brother and sister than a romantic couple. I grew a lot as a person because of that relationship and want to take some time to be single so I can continue working on myself. I've been incredibly open about my desire to stay single for a while, to the point that I'm starting to annoy myself because I say it so often.\r\n\r\nEven before that relationship ended, I had guys hitting me up. I'm not saying this to brag but I'm kind of cute and I got tig ol' bitties. Being clear that I was in a relationship and that they would get nothing but friendship from me was a good way to weed out the ones who had ulterior motives. There were a few instances of Nice Guys who tried to ride it out under the guise of friendship and slide in at what they thought was their opportune moment. I always ended those \"friendships\" as soon as their true intentions were revealed.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm single, lots of guys are hitting me up. Some of them are new friends (I've been forcing myself to go out a lot and meet people because I have a bad habit of isolating myself) and some of them are older acquaintances that I didn't have as much time for when I was in a relationship. I've tried to make it abundantly clear to each and every one of them that I will not be getting romantically involved with anyone for the indefinite future. The only person I plan to date right now is me. She's #1 in my life.\r\n\r\nEveryone says they understand and acts like they respect those boundaries. But there are a few who I strongly suspect have ulterior motives and are trying to ride it out Nice Guy style in hopes that I'll change my mind and they'll be first in line to fill the role of New Boyfriend. The problem is that none of them have said or done anything that outright says this is what they're doing. I only have my gut instinct and some subtle signs to go on. And I would feel like a huge dick for cutting a real friend out of my life because I was bad at reading social cues.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I feel like an asshole for allowing it to continue. I feel like I'm enabling it by still talking to them, hanging out with them, letting them pick up the tab even though I try to insist that we split it, etc. On the other hand, I am being completely open and honest about what I'm looking for right now. I feels like it shouldn't be my responsibility to police their intentions. I'm completely torn here and I could use some outside perspective. Thanks y'all.\r\n\r\nTl;dr - Being very open about wanting to stay single for a while, suspect some of my male friends have ulterior Nice Guy motives but don't have any definite proof, unsure if continuing those friendships is an asshole move or not.\r\n\r\nEdit: Letting them pick up the tab has come up more than once in the comments, so I figured I should elaborate. I've been out of work since before the break up (that's another long story) and will have to move out of the apartment I share with my ex soon. I don't openly talk about my finances, but it's not hard to figure out that I'm in a less than ideal spot at the moment. I ALWAYS go out fully prepared to pay my half of the tab. A lot of my friends (male and female) are insisting that they cover all or most of it, and I always promise that I'll get the next one once I'm working again, which should be soon.

Our coffee shop uses plain white paper cups, so the barista who takes the order writes whatever the order is on the cup in black sharpie and passes it along to the barista making the drinks so they know what's going in each cup and they don't get confused.

I pointedly ignored that comment too.\r\n\r\nLater on,  after we went back home, while texting, she asked me to send her a selfie. I did, and in it only the collar of my jacket was visible. I was wearing a nice outfit underneath, which wasn't visible. She said 'Oh nice outfit :P' and I said 'You can't see the outfit', and she said 'I can guess what you would be wearing based on the collar and the crease'. I said something like 'I bet you can't guess!' hoping she would ask me what I'm wearing and I would show her the dressy outfit underneath, but she said something like 'I already guessed what kind of clothes you would be wearing. At least this is better than your baby pink top :p'. I got very annoyed at this and ignored the messages pertaining to this conversation completely, and only spoke about other things normally.\r\n\r\nIn another conversation, she randomly asked me one day whether I eat protein after my workouts. I just said that yes, I do, and why did she ask? She said 'You need about 1.5g of protein per kg, so maybe you aren't eating enough, that's why you don't have muscle mass'. I just said 'Okay. Thanks.' She went on to ask if I had a personal trainer or a gym partner. I finally told her that her comments about my clothes and other things annoy me. She said that she just thought they were some playful comments, but she won't make them henceforth. I said that I could take a few playful comments, but I thought they had become a theme recently. I told her that if I needed advice on the gym stuff I would ask her. She said 'I really like how you don't care about what you wear sometimes and you seemed to like it when I made these comments in college'. So I told her that I didn't care about it that much then, but recently I had been putting in more effort and I have become more vocal about such things. She thanked me for letting me know.\r\n\r\nI thought that would be it, but I told my girlfriend about the exchange and she couldn't understand why I would get upset about such small things and why I would bring it up with her. The next day, my friend got back to me saying that she felt that it was unfair that I told her about all this just now and not during college She said that I was one of the few friends that she thought she could speak freely to, and now she thinks that I am secretly annoyed by her and am not telling her.

They didn't believe his business could directly compete against 2 already established local businesses in the area and they strongly discouraged him from quitting his job. \r\n\r\nXavier was crushed by his family's reaction. He turned to me for support and (naively) I gave it to him. I strongly encouraged him to pursue his dreams. I told him he was clever,  hard working, dedicated and perserverent and he could achieve anything he set his mind to. I encouraged Xavier to live his life without regrets and rise up to the challenge. Basically a lot of motivational crap talk that in hindsight seems stupid now. \r\n\r\n At the time,  I genuinely believed Xavier had a decent chance of succeeding because he has a brilliant work ethic and a brilliant mind. However,  I knew there was also a good chance he would fail and lose money but I assumed Xavier knew the risks. \r\n\r\nFlash forward to today and Xavier's family were right - Xavier's business turned out to be a complete flop. There aren't enough clients for the business to be sustainable and he can't compete against the local competition. Xavier's in massive debt (he put all of his savings into the business and also took out a massive business loan) and he's been forced to close the business because he cannot keep it in operation without pouring more money into it. Now Xavier's currently looking for a full time job to replace the job he once had. He's also had to move back in with his parents because he can't afford rent or bills right now. \r\n\r\nAlthough the choice was ultimately Xavier's,  I am recieving all the blame from Xavier's family for steering him in the wrong direction. They believe he would have never quit his job if it wasn't for me. His Father believes I fed him false hope and pretty much ruined his life. His Mother sent me a ridiculously long  message saying  I was happy to let Xavier crash and burn because our finances are seperate and if I really loved him I would have looked out more for his financial security. \r\n\r\nXavier doesn't blame me at all and our relationship is still strong despite what his family thinks. \r\n\r\nWas I an asshole?

Basically everyone close to us is aware that we don't drink, but now I'm concerned that there might be people coming (SOs of friends, family we see less often, etc.) that aren't aware of it and they might be offended. We really don't want people to bring alcohol or try to sneak it in (our venue isn't dry but you have to pay more if you want alcohol to be allowed and we aren't planning on doing that - however we could easily afford it so it is not a financial issue).

REALLY poor. Making soup out tomato ketchup and hot water poor. Everything I have done has been so I can make my life as I want it. I work freelance and I'm really good at it, I'm not going to apologise for that. Also means that I have no back up if something was to happen to me, so my savings are for if/when that happens. \r\n\r\n3. My bf and I have had a conversation since I posted about this. I felt it was important. He still stands by if he was to go to his parents that we should break up. What I meant by him moving back to them for the year, that was when someone here said we would see each other when we could. His parents are closer to school and where we are is like 1.5 hours away. He's too proud for that though. \r\n\r\n4. Sure, whether he goes or stays my rent will be the same, but I'm not getting that 20-25% from which I've been able to save with my income. \r\n\r\n5. His masters is in something to do with English literature, and the job that he just quit, for all I knew he loved it. Now he's quit to do a (in my eyes) pointless masters? No. If it was medical school or engineering or a good job where he NEEDED a masters, I'd probably be more on board with it.\r\n\r\n6.

I'm not even requesting she do the same, just an Asian one. She said she'd be OK with that but also asked why its such a big deal and asked if I'd love the child any less if he or she wasn't part Asian. This is insane, of course I would love any child she has and that we raise together, I just want them to also look like me on some level, we are both the mothers of the child.

So when I got engaged she was constantly saying how she didn't want to work my wedding. Now I took this as 'she wants to be able to sit and enjoy the wedding as a guest'. So I didn't make her part of my bridal party. She still went wedding dress shopping with me and was there when we picked out the dress and I keep her in the loop on everything, her youngest son's are gonna be ring bearers and I talk to her about it a good bit.\r\n     Figuring she didn't want to be part of the wedding party I made my two closest friends from undergrad bridesmaids and a cousin of mine,who is really more sister than cousin, maid of honor. I was trying to keep the bridal party small since my fiance will only have 2 groomsmen, so I had to carefully select my girls. Now I know what you must be thinking \"a cousin over your sister, how could you do such a thing\". Well, Me and my cousin have always been really close. We have the same interests, similar personalities and we're closer in age. My sister, while I love her, is basically my opposite. We don't agree on anything, like any of the same stuff, we're 14 years apart, and our personalities have only become more and more polar over the years, almost to a crazy degree (she believes in the Illuminati, is super conservative, believes in demons and ghosts and whatnot). \r\n        Getting to the point, I get a call from my mom today and she tells me that the last time she and my sister were together my sister told her that it really hurt her to not be asked to be part of the wedding. Now, I'm mostly annoyed at this point because 1) why didn't she bring this up earlier, she's known about this for months. And 2) why didn't she tell me? Why did she go through mom? Well mom tells me I need to talk to her about it and explain to her why I didn't make her part of the wedding, explain that it was a miscommunication. But now I'm worried if I do make her a bridesmaid if it'll seem like I'm just doing it cause 'mom told me to' and I'm worried about her not quite enjoying things for the bridal party like the trip to Harry Potter world. (I know she'll enjoy herself and it'll be fun, but idk how she'll mesh with the rest of the group). I'm calling her this Saturday because it's the next time I'll be off and I'll probably need a whole day to talk to her about this because she can talk for hours just having a casual conversation.\r\n\r\nSo AITA? Is this me being socially inept or is this a mistake anyone would've made?\r\n\r\nTL;DR my sister didn't want to work the wedding. I took this as 'she just wants to be a guest' and didn't make her part of the wedding party, but I make sure that she's still involved in everything. Mom calls me and tells me sister is upset that she wasn't asked to be in the wedding.

She was on the lowest dosage possible because of this. Now, call us paranoid but, since we aren't ready for kids, during that time we also used condoms during sex just a secondary precaution. This is something we had both agreed to, and my knowledge, neither of us has any objections to it. I'm fact, she was the first to suggest we do this. We never had unprotected sex, and at most we'd start for a short time but, then I'd put a condom on for the rest of the session.\r\n\r\n Today, she had an appointment with her gynecologist and was told that her condition has gotten better to the point that she can have some time without birth control once her pills run out (in about a week). She called me to tell me this and I was very happy for her, I've known how much she hates the side effects of birth control pills and was genuinely happy. During conversation, I realized we'd be down to just condoms now and suggested we'd have to look for a new non-hormonal (to avoid side effects) method to go along with condoms. Well, she got upset and said me suggesting this didn't make her feel good because she feels like I think she'll trap me with a baby now. That's not the case at all. I trust her fully, I just know that woman can still become pregnant even when condoms are used (unnoticed breaks, it slipping off, etc.) and based on our agreement before, I thought it wouldn't be an issue to suggest. She didn't wanna stay on the phone and texting has been extremely slow since.

I'm in one of these two rooms, in the other is one of my roommates (we'll call her B). The thin wall lets through a lot of noise (you can hear netflix playing on a laptop, for example) and definitely compromises privacy (my boyfriend and I have mastered the art of having super-silent sex), but it's in an amazing part of NYC and so it's absolutely worth it. \r\n\r\nSo, B just texted my other roommate (C) and I, telling us that her parents will be staying in her room tomorrow night (which I suppose is fine, just a bit unexpected), as they've come to town to surprise her.

When we first started dating, both of us were pretty against gifts and such, but have done things for each other despite that. Over the years, I have realized it makes me feel good to make a little extra effort and get him something when these occasions come up. I've also realized that it feels really good when he does the same for me.  Our anniversary, my birthday, Christmas, and his birthday all happen within a span of two months, so it definitely feels like everything is crammed together. All of his efforts are appreciated, but I'm finding myself a little annoyed/disappointed that it feels like I'm the only one thinking ahead and making the effort prior to the day of. It has kinda left me feeling like I'm not worth the foresight and thought of him planning something for me ahead of time. I feel shitty and entitled saying that, but those feelings have crept in regardless. I try to make holidays and stuff special for my daughter (7F), and want to include him and I, so that it is more of a family day for all of us to enjoy, rather than me just getting her a bunch of stuff while we watch her open them. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nOn our anniversary this year, I arranged for his gift to be delivered via Email on the day of, having ordered it the week prior, and got a card and wrote a nice note for him.

For my birthday, my request was a meal that I didn't have to cook, and chores done for me, since I take care of the bulk of the housework. We went out for a nice dinner and dessert, and he got me some nice hair care and soaps that we stopped for after dinner (and this was at my request. I had initially planned to purchase them myself.). My only request that wasn't fulfilled was chores, which I was admittedly disappointed about, but brushed it off, since my birthday isn't an excuse to get out of day to day responsibilities.

Walking through the aisles, I noticed a woman about my age wearing a 3mo baby, with a 3yo little girl by her side.  I took notice because those are the approximate age of my own two daughters.

We make our way to the checkout counter at the same time, and she is in front of me (Aldi seems to only ever have one counter opened at a time).  By the time she is done paying, the baby is full on red-faced screaming.  You can hear her all over the store.

She was my arch-rival when we were kids, my bully, my friend, my first date and now, an irreplaceable partner that I have and love. We have 2 children, aged 7 and 3, and we are a happy family. She also has a trait of being a little too concerned about me and it's starting to bother me a little.\r\n\r\nMy wife is a SAHM, out of her own choice, whereas I'm the breadwinner. I normally work 13 hours per day (6am-7pm), 6 days a week and I earn a very good wage for it too. My usual routine is whenever I arrive home, I'd normally have a shower, eat dinner, kiss the kids in bed and either just go do my own stuff or do some things with my wife like talking or just watching TV together. It really bonds us together, it's lovely.\r\n\r\nRecently, I had to scratch that routine we had because one of my colleagues left the country a week ago (her grandfather died and she had to attend the funeral there) and she won't be around until Christmas, so my boss (knowing that I was his most reliable employee) requested if I can extend my work hours by a few to cover up for now and that he will give about 20% more than what I earn usually if I can do this. I agreed, and I'm working 16 hours per day for now.\r\n\r\nMy wife was only able to put up with this for about 4 days before she finally snapped. She's throwing a tantrum about this and keeps on saying that I should tell my boss that I can't do this anymore. She feels really uncomfortable that I arrive 3 hours later and just fall on the couch and sleep without saying anything.\r\n\r\nI told her that while it's true that I'm a little tired of this new schedule I have to deal with and I appreciate the concern and love that she has for me, I'm earning 20% more and it would be a lie if I tell my boss that I absolutely cannot take it anymore. I reassured here that everything will be returning back to normal just in time for Christmas.

Tl;dr at the bottom in case I end up waffling on.\r\n\r\nI (22M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend (23F) by this time next year. \r\n\r\nSo backstory, my girlfriend is obsessed with weddings. She has an obsession with watching wedding tv shows (especially ones focussed on the dress) and loves pricing up hypothetical weddings. All of this I'm completely fine with as I know I want to marry this girl and I think the world of her and marriage at this stage would have been a natural thought process regardless.\r\n\r\nThe reason that is all relevant is because she basically has an entire wedding planned out for if/when she gets married. I myself have no preconceptions about what I want for the wedding as long as the food is nice and there's at least one or two good beers on tap so I've said to her if/when we get married, she can basically plan it all. (This is not me burdening her with an incredibly stressful job, she beamed ear to ear when this suggestion was made, if she does want my help and input I will happily help).\r\n\r\nAlso she is a shopaholic. She shops at every opportunity she gets and it is her favourite way of passing time. \r\n\r\nIn discussion about weddings etc she tells me she has said her dream would be to shop for her own engagement ring. I myself want it to be a surprise when I propose and pick out the perfect ring for her to show her how well I know her and for it to be a surprise.\r\n\r\nNow, she can be fussy when it comes to jewellery. She is always grateful when it is bought for her and wears it when the person who bought it for her is around, but you can tell when she actually likes something or not as long as you aren't the person who bought it for her. Noticeably, she won't wear it unless that person is around. Hence why she has always wanted a watch but has never bought one due to how picky she is.\r\n\r\nRecently, when shopping I have noticed if I go into a shop to look at watches for myself I have noticed that she will get bored and look at rings so I have started playing a game of 'guess my favourite watch' as she will return with 'guess my favourite ring'. Because of this I have a list on my phone of every ring she has pointed out as her favourite and because of this I feel I could find a perfect ring. \r\n\r\nBasically I want to surprise her when I propose to her and sweep her off her feet by doing what she deems impossible and give her the perfect ring to go alongside what will hopefully be a perfect day for her. So WIBTA for risking messing it all up by doing something she explicitly said is the opposite of what she wants?\r\n\r\n\r\nTl;dr: my girlfriend has always dreamed of shopping for her own engagement ring but i want to surprise her with a well thought out perfect ring."}, "1337": {"id": "b0y9s1", "title": "AITA for lying to my friend about how she changed her clothes?", "body": "Hey guys,\r\nfirst time posting and english is not my mothertongue, so please have mercy.\r\n\r\nSo I (M23) met this girl (F21) online and we know for about around 2 years.

The plan was actually that she rides a train home, but it was too late and I wouldnt have let her go home alone in her state anyway.\r\n\r\nSo after what felt like 4 hours we arrived at my hotel and I took her to my room. I gave her a shirt and sweatpants and told her to get changed in the bathroom. After some minutes i asked if everythings ok, but didnt get an answer. So i went into the bathroom to look after her. She was sitting on the floor unchanged and crying. She told me she is in a fresh relationship ~1month and she had a guilty conscience for getting drunk. \r\n\r\nBetween her and me nothing sexual happened and I wasnt even planning it. Just two friends hanging out. Had the feeling to throw that in.\r\n\r\nI once again told her to get changed and brushed my teeths in the meantime.

Our relationship began professionally but the lines blurred and we became really good friends, sending each other presents in the mail (we live in different countries) and talking almost every day. \r\n\r\nBefore we got close, she did warn me that she sometimes stops talking to her friends for a while to \u201crecharge\u201d, I can\u2019t remember how she put it. It sounded like she just needed her space sometimes and I got that. She\u2019s super introverted. \r\n\r\nIt happened with us a couple times... She would just disappear from social media and messages for up to two weeks at a time maybe 2-3 times a year or so. Nothing major. She always came back and explained what she had been doing during that period. Sometimes she was dealing with her mental health or she was just too stressed out or I don\u2019t know.

My dad was invited to join us since I'm his son too and it's a pretty monumental day for me (and my paternal family are only ever proud of me for my academic achievements, so I figured it'd be nice to have him be proud of me for a day). Having my dad, mam and SD around at the same time isn't an issue, as my bio parents get along fine and my dad and SD get along very well too.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThe problem then lies in the fact that my dad wants to bring my stepmum (SM). SM has a long history of being unable to be civil with my mam, starting arguments and, in the years I lived with my dad and SM, trying to prevent me from seeing my mam entirely. I know that if she comes, she'll refuse to speak to my mam and SD, and there might even be conflict. All in all, the day will be incredibly awkward and tense, and I'm not interested in having such an important day ruined by it.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI understand that my dad is driving several hours to be there for me and probably wants some company, and that my SM is technically my family too (although I barely see her and she's done more harm to me and my relationships than good), but I can't trust SM to be friendly or even civil for the duration of the day and it's more important to me that my mam and SD are there as they've supported me in the last two years and are helping to fund uni as much as they can. SM has ruined several big occasions for my mam by not allowing her to be there (my secondary school prom, for example) and my mam is also not eager for this occasion to be ruined too, especially considering both my dad and SM are the main reasons I didn't speak to my mam for several years because of their lies and actions.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy dad has made it clear that he's not happy with SM not being there, and he's always had a stick up his ass about me being close to SD but not SM.

My sister is my only sibling. When I got married a few years ago she was my maid of honour and only adult bridesmaid. In fact I never even formally asked her. When I told her I was engaged, she told me she was a bridesmaid.\r\n\r\nShe is also the only godmother to my two children. This was her rule that if she was godmother to one child she had to be godmother to both to prevent favouritism.\r\n\r\nHer fianc\u00e9 is my husband\u2019s close childhood friend. They actually met at our wedding and dated a bit back then. Then they went their separate ways. \r\n\r\nWhen she express her regret about this to me earlier this year I intervened on her behalf and got them in touch again and now they\u2019re engaged.\r\n\r\nI know that this doesn\u2019t mean she owes me anything but it\u2019s really torn me apart that she doesn\u2019t want me as her bridesmaid. It\u2019s just something I thought would always happen from way back in childhood.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, she once said she would have my girls as bridesmaids/flower girls but has now said she MIGHT have the older one (who would be 6 by the wedding) but not the other one (who would be 2 and a half) and that breaks my heart too. They love their auntie and it hurts that she doesn\u2019t seem to want them involved.\r\n\r\nWorse still is that the younger one who she\u2019s excluding is actually her and her fianc\u00e9s mutual godchild as they were separately chosen as god parents before being together. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m pasting on a happy face and asking her about dresses and colours etc but inside I\u2019m just thinking \u2018Am I being selfish?

But that waned once I moved and we had less contact. We started texting less, and our texts would become days apart. When we did meet up though, I would feel incredible during and afterwards, and she said so too. But, our meetings are far and between, and she cancels quite often. She says it\u2019s because her parents don\u2019t let her go anywhere, that they don\u2019t like to drive, that they feel lazy that day, or that the drive is too far. In response, I pick locations closer that are more convenient for her, despite me not having very good means of transportation, (my mom doesn\u2019t know how to drive, my stepdad won\u2019t drive me because he\u2019s at work and we don\u2019t have a great relationship, so I take an Uber). \r\n\r\nEven though we are good friends, I feel insecure about this. I feel like some reasons she gives for not meeting up or texting back aren\u2019t genuine. This is mostly because she talks about visiting with other friends and etc all the time,and her parents let her. With me, however, she says her parents don\u2019t want her to see me for some reason. She says it\u2019s because she thinks they don\u2019t like me and they think that I\u2019m a lesbian or something. (I honestly don\u2019t know where that came from?)\r\n\r\nAs an explanation for her sporadic texts, she says it\u2019s because her phone isn\u2019t working and she doesn\u2019t receive the texts until a few days later. I kind of don\u2019t buy that. It\u2019s to the point where I feel like she\u2019s making excuses to not face the fact that she isn\u2019t interested in our friendship anymore. I mean, at first, i didn\u2019t mind because I\u2019m not a frequent texter either. But, the infrequency of her texts are sometimes a bit agitating when we\u2019re trying to plan things. A difference between her and I is that I try and do respond a lot more quickly when we are planning things to make it more convenient and quick. However, sometimes she responds a confirmation that she\u2019ll be going a few hours before the date we\u2019ve set. \r\n\r\nIt was the final straw when we were making plans recently. I had three days off work last week, and I announced to her that I\u2019d wanted to make plans with her on those days. She responded that she was interested, then I asked her what day and time would be best. She responded late in the afternoon on my final day off and said she was busy.

The future we had planned involved both of each other heavily. She has also been struggling with depression, and she says she confides in me the most and trust me the most, so I\u2019m reluctant to cut her off. Even then, I still feel like I should because I feel like she doesn\u2019t help me when I\u2019m going through hard times.

Overall him and I do not have a good relationship and barely act civil. And this is when we are both sober.\r\n\r\nThe other friend is someone we've known for about 6 years. She's even more immature, constantly brings up drama from high school, and is always getting involved with my friend and her ex. An example is when my friend confided in her that she wasn't sure how she was feeling about her ex anymore and might have feelings for him again, this \"friend\" ran to text the ex and that's what started their most recent fling.\r\n\r\nThe night will consist of the three of them getting drunk while I remain sober. My friend is a light weight to the extreme so I'll have to be the one babysitting her, making sure she doesn't embarrass herself, or drink herself to death.

She once broke off their marriage in my apartment parking lot and completely lashed out on me when I told my then-boyfriend about how toxic their marriage had become. I was literally having a mental breakdown to him about it all, because I was always put in the middle.

My husband isn't picky on the type of car he drives. A lot to do with the way he was raised. His parents always bought used cars, and kept them till they broke (he learned to drive on a 13-year old basic car w/ duct tape). His parents could afford nice cars, but chose not to.

While we put most of our paycheques in a joint account, we also keep 20% for personal use. For something like a car, we agreed that the joint savings would only cover up to $30,000 of the cost.

Yes he thinks my Mercedes is excessive, but like I said, I paid for it within the terms of the financial deal we agreed to.\r\n\r\nMy kids think that \"mommy is being unfair\" and \"needs to share\" (they know I make more).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEDIT: Kids are 5 & 7"}, "1362": {"id": "c3y9xp", "title": "WIBTA for me to leave my elderly parents at 18", "body": "Would I be the asshole if I left my elderly parents alone at 18?

Since I was traveling alone I decided to hit up in advance other solo-travelers in different social media groups and coordinate to meet up with people with similar itineraries in different cities to hang out and have fun.\r\n\r\nThis is how I met (let call her) Anna (32F) from say Finland. Anna seemed smart, cool, and outgoing, and we messaged back and forth a lot planning the stuff we could do. I ended up taking care of most of the logistics and reservations, since Anna was going to be in my first city/country for less time than me (4 days vs my 7), so I basically catered to her wishes and ended up doing her must-sees list during those 4 days. I didn't mind, we had a blast, and soon we discovered we liked each other a lot, and got rather intimate with each other. Anna however was sometimes not a happy camper and was sometimes quite temperamental and not very outgoing, alienating some of the other people we were meeting up with. I'm a patient and tolerant guy so I paid no attention to it, plus I was having too much fun.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, so we went ou**r** separate ways and I continued on my trip. All the while, Anna **had** begun acting like my GF. I was happy and hopeful about Anna. We were messaging each other, face-timing, and having long conversations while away. She soon invited me to visit her, so I changed my plans in order to spend time with her.\r\n\r\nSadly, a couple days before I was to fly to see Anna. I got a call from my mother that my brother had died. So I interrupted my trip, and flew back to the US to be with family, grieve, and help plan the funeral. Anna was very understanding, we kept in touch still and I promised her that someday soon I'll come back to Europe visit her in Finland.\r\n\r\nA couple weeks go by, and Anna txtd me, asking how I was... and said that she had big news and changes in her life, but that she doesn't know if she should tell me, that I might hate her for it. I was confused but intrigued, expecting it to be that she got a promotion, new job, or moving to another country or both. I say that she can tell me anything... Well, she's pregnant (not by me) and doesn't know if she wants to keep it or not. I was numb and at a loss for words. I told her that she must follow her heart and then that it was very late where I was and ended the conversation. I've never contacted her since then... I can't help but be feeling betrayed and a bit misled, on top of the feelings and depression I'm going thru due to losing my brother.\r\n\r\nI understand that it was a travel fling that turned or was turning into a long distance relationship (if we can call it that), but she must have gotten pregnant very soon after I met her, meaning she really didn't care about me... and wanted me to visit her while she was sleeping with other people. She keeps messaging me, asking if I am mad at her, and why I don't want to keep in touch with her anymore.\r\n\r\n**So, AITA for now wanting to cut ties with Anna?**\r\n\r\n**Edit 1: I'm 100% NOT the father, as we didn't have sexual contact.

She attended some of our family holiday get-togethers this year and didn't bring up her kids at all. Some of my family members that talked to her had no idea she even had children. I understand not wanting to talk about how you're in the middle of a supposed separation, but it's your first holiday away from your kids and you don't mention they exist? I just think it's strange.\r\n\r\nI recently found out I've been accepted into an internship abroad and will be leaving in several months.

For example, if we start getting loud then the boy will interrupt us and tell us we\u2019re being stupid for yelling and fighting over whatever.

He's convinced that by living somewhere where everything is less expensive we'll have a better quality of life. He doesn't have a job there, hasn't applied for any (legal or otherwise), but thinks he'll be happy doing anything because life will just be better - even though he's very intelligent and gets bored if he doesn't have a challenging job to do.

My friends are also giving me mixed advice, which is why I'm posting here.\r\n\r\nMy mom has been dating this guy for about two and a half months now. Why they thought it was a good idea to move in so quickly is beyond me, but that's beside the point. Well, it's not beyond me why HE wanted to move in, but I'll get to that. Overall, this guy is okay. I'm not going to say hes great, or even good. But he's tolerable. We both don't like each other, and we both know it. Neither one of us has explicitly said nor done anything; we are not trying to start shit. We manage to just coexist.\r\n\r\nI don't so much care about my relationship with him. I have a dad, he lives 15 minutes away and we have a good relationship. I have my driver's license I can go see him whenever I want. The only thing that really matters to me is his effect on my mom and on my younger sister (10 years old). \r\n\r\nMy mom usually seems to be happy with him. Happier than when she was single, at least. There are no major problems at the moment, but I feel like there are some red flags that shouldn't be ignored. \r\n\r\nFirst off, he drinks too much. I'm not going to say he's an alcoholic, it's not that bad (yet). But once a week or so, he gets home real late at night a little tipsy. He's definitely not the type of person I want my mom being with when he's drunk. He's not physically violent, but he has a shortened fuse and is always looking for something to complain about. I can see how sad my mom gets, and how scared my sister gets when he's like this. There is a high probability, in my opinion, that things could get worse. It really would only take one more bump in the road for him to completely fall off. I think it's best if we get out of this situation before the inevitable.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he's just a self-centered person. Everything he does is about him/ for him. He never does ANYTHING for other people. And when he does, it's always with a groan and because he has to. It's not like he's out working long hours to put food on the table either. He works four half-days per week bagging groceries. I, a 16 year old, work more hours, at a harder job, to get more money, and go to school at the same time. He basically uses my mom for a house and for sex (which there is a LOT of, not that it matters, really).\r\n\r\nSo, reddit, WIBTA if I talked to my mom and told her that I don't think this man is good for her/us in the future?"}, "1391": {"id": "ehm6s0", "title": "WIBTA for ignoring my brother's birthday", "body": "First time poster here. Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile. I (25F) have an older brother (26) who lives out of state. His birthday is coming up in less than 2 weeks and I'm considering ignoring it. No happy birthday message or gift. I'm pretty annoyed with him right now because for the holidays I sent him and my parents gifts. They all live in the same city, about 9 hours by car from my husband and i. My brother texts me on December 23 asking what he should get my mother for Christmas. This annoyed me for 2 reasons:he lives with her and should have a better idea what she would want than me considering i haven't lived at home since getting married almost 3 years ago and two its the damn 23rd! The likelihood of getting a decent, thoughtful gift that late are pretty slim. I ended up suggesting a DVD set of this show I know she loves which was going to be my birthday gift for her but whatever. I'll come up with something else, I have months. In this convo he also asked me what I wanted. I was annoyed because I had shipped my gift for all of them like a week beforehand so it would get there on time. I couldn't think of anything in the moment because I was still doing holiday things for my husband and very stressed so I said \"idk I guess nothing\". So that's exactly what I got. Not even a text even though I wished him merry Christmas on the day. Now I'm considering ignoring his birthday but itll be obvious I'm ignoring it because my brother's birthday is one day after our dad's. So if I get dad a gift itll be clear I'm snubbing my brother. But I'm angry at my brother for being thoughtless and honestly a little bitter about how he treats my mom while living with her buts that's a different post for a different sub. So WIBTA for snubbing my brother on his birthday?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nPeople have asked if I'm ready to burn bridges with my brother over this and honestly the answer is yes. It's been years of me being thoughtful and kind with nothing reciprocated. We haven't been close since I went away to school at 18. That makes this now 7 years of either no gifts or meaningless nothings while I am always going out of my way to be kind. I didn't even get anything from him when I got married! Maybe if this was one mistake in an otherwise good relationship i wouldn't be so annoyed but I'm sick of this dynamic in my family in which the women plan and are giving and the men are thoughtless and scrambling at the last minute. I'll be getting my father the gift I planned and ignoring my brother. If he has a problem then he can reach out to me\r\n\r\nEdit 2:\r\nI realized none of you matter and neither does my relationship with my brother.

I have been wanting to tell him for years why they got divorce but never could.\r\n\r\nThe reason they got divorce is because our dad caught my brother's mom, Rowena (not her real name) and his friend James (also not his real name) having sex in his bed.

My family's never really been close, but we're trying to get better now that my abusive dad is out of the picture.\r\n\r\nMy bro is the spitting image of dad sometimes (just without the malice). It's not his fault, exactly, because 1) his mental health issues are pretty bad, and 2) he has hallucinations and paranoia so I think he thinks we're meaner to him than we really are. He got very depressed very fast in his mid-twenties and had to come home.\r\n\r\nI resented him a little because my mom spent so much of her time caring for him while I got pushed off to study overseas. Everything was about my brother for a while. And it's not anyone's fault because he was so sick but I spent a long time feeling really neglected. I didn't understand depression back then and would say insensitive things, like he was just lazy. My brother was looking for a friend and I wasn't there for him. We were never close growing up because of the age gap but he was looking for help and I didn't give it to him.\r\n\r\nThen I got depressed and had to come home after I graduated, and things got hostile. BPD happened and bro'd go into these rage fits. I was his primary target. It never got physical. He thought my mom was being nicer to me than she was to him (she was, bc of experience). So he got cruel. He has said some really mean things that really hurt me. I never fought back. And for a while I would avoid him because he reminded me of my dad.\r\n\r\nNow he's changed a lot. He got help last year and he's become a much calmer, kinder person, and we haven't really fought at all lately.

Honestly I don't know what else he could do to make it up to me.\r\n\r\nBut I think now I'm the mean one. I'm rude to him for no reason.

That's great because it brought in a lot of people and updated the game. The thing is that it also doesn't track your original Halo Reach career so you start off at square one.

My arguement is, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything. I would pay for it, pay for insurance, and pay for any maintenence. My mom says that I still live under her roof, and I would be keeping it in her garage. She even threatened to kick me out.

That we've barley spent a week apart since I moved in and we both should be comfortable with medium lengths of time apart, it's a healthy thing.

We were both coming out of failed relationships and we both knew what we wanted. We are planning to move out together by the end of the year. She works in the city center, we both live just outside the city, she lives at 5-10 minutes walking distance from the metro station, I live at 10-15 minutes by car. I have a pretty standard 9-5 job, while she is working in this huge international lawfirm and she usually is never leaving the office before 8.30 pm. \r\nWhen we first started dating she used to have a parking spot at the metro station, just because the walk from metro station to her place after 21 pm is potentially dangerous (it's a very nice residential neighborhood but at night it's very dark and no one's around, so it can definitely feel unsafe). So she pretty much went to the metro station by car everyday and that was it. \r\nUntil her father (who is the actual owner of the parking spot and is not on good terms with gf and her mother) came back in town and started using it (please note that parking near the metro station is considered a privilege in our town and it's nearly impossible if you don't own a spot). So she started walking to the metro station, which is not a problem in the morning, and since I was deeply uncomfortable with the idea of letting my gf walk alone at night I started picking her up from the metro station. \r\nThe problem is: I can't be there every single week day, I am often away for business trips and I can be occasionally out with my friends. She has never expected me to come pick her up and is actually so grateful that I'm there when she needs it, but I feel so bad when I can't give her a ride home. I feel such an asshole when I'm not there and know she will have to walk home or take the bus if she manages to catch it.

In the last couple years, after seeing most of our close friends become parents, my husband came to the decision that he does really want kids. He never pressured me and understood I may decide I didn\u2019t want them and always said he\u2019d be ok if that were the case. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years a lot of great things have fallen in place for us. We bought a beautiful house, he was promoted to CFO at his job and now makes really good money, I found a teaching job in the district I had always really wanted to be in (I spent the first 5 years of my teaching career being laid off or bounced between schools). I decided that I was really comfortable with where things were and I was ready to start thinking about getting pregnant and starting a family. I told my husband and he was elated. We decided this summer would be a good time to begin trying. I talked with my OBGYN, began taking prenatal vitamins, and everything was good. \r\n\r\nThen a couple weeks ago, I got a lay-off notice from my job.

The line was right next to the bar and I could see the main dining area. While in line, I saw her already sitting there and I swear my heart stopped. She was so so beautiful and she almost appeared to be glowing. My anxiety shot through the roof and my only thought was \"she deserves so much better\". So what I did was I stepped out of line and looked around the bar. I found a pretty good looking guy who for some reason, was there by himself and I gave him the flowers and my card and told him to have dinner with her that night, which he did. Once he checked in, I left the restaurant and went home and just curled up on my floor (I live in a very small studio and own no furniture)\r\n\r\nThe next day, I see her and she appears to be happy. During lunch, I actually approached her and apologized for my absence and told her the 15 second version of what you just read. She invited me to eat with her and we talked and talked.

She came right away, tended to me and she's always been there like that. One measley year older than me but always more a mother to me than my own mother....\r\n\r\nAnyways, that's the background, on to the point: I just broke up with BF of 4 years, he moved out Friday 10 days ago so fairly recently. And my mom's been calling everyday, and I am not having it, I don't even answer her calls, I'm too raw emotionally. She was never there for me before, I am not leaning on her for support now.

We made the plans about two weeks ago since we had to reserve the day for one of the activities. \r\n\r\nBack Story: We have been friends for about 10 years  but for the last 4 years our friendship has been rocky. It started when I got a boyfriend ( four years ago). I was spending most of my time with him and not her. What really made things worse was that she tried making plans with me on three separate occasions and I had already made plans. She thought I was blowing her off but I genuinely had other plans. Two were family get togethers and I believe one of them was for my boyfriend\u2019s family party. That all happened in the first year I was with my boyfriend and since then we\u2019ve talked about our feelings and I promised I was going to make time for her. I try to hang out with her when we both have days off but since our schedules are pretty off it\u2019s usually once a month ( which she\u2019s ok with). I do text her funny pictures or ask her how she\u2019s doing in between our hang outs. \r\n\r\nFast forward to now and her birthday. She had told me that people were telling her not to invite me on the trip because I would say no. This hurt my feelings because I was  planning on celebrating her birthday with her no matter what. I was going to hopefully take her to dinner or the movies and just spend time with her but she wanted to take the trip and that was fine with me. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing. Her birthday is on a Friday. I have two part time jobs working at a school. One of the schools I work for started the first week of August and the other job starts tomorrow, so I would have to call off both jobs to go. She suggested we could do it on a Saturday if I had a problem with Friday but she was already almost done with making the plans and she said the whole point of doing it on Friday was that it was her actual birthday.At the time,  I didn\u2019t mind calling off of work for that one day because I knew it was important for the sake of our friendship.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is my wisdom tooth. It has been hurting for the past four days. I called off from one of my jobs today to go to the dentist. My jaw is starting to swell and I need it to be removed but the earliest appointment is next Thursday( the day before her birthday).  I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to call off work two days in a row to both jobs, especially because the school for one of my jobs started the first week of August and the other job starts tomorrow( one week before her birthday) . I really want to get my wisdom tooth removed as soon as possible but if I do call off on Thursday and Friday, I\u2019m afraid it will look unprofessional. I haven\u2019t told my friend about it because I\u2019m worried she won\u2019t understand.

Around the 6 month mark she informed me that she does not enjoy sex that much, and would prefer it to occur around once a week. I would like it to be more frequent than this, but I respected her wishes and I generally initiate once a week. \r\n\r\nHowever, throughout our relationship she has enjoyed using her vibrators/dildos without me (yes, I have asked to use it on her and she has turned me down) 3-4x a week. I don't have a problem with this necessarily - of I course I wish she was using that energy with me, but I get that sometimes people can be in the mood for masturbating and not sex. I watch porn regularly and she doesn't like it, but hasn't explicitly asked me to stop. \r\n\r\nThat leads us to the issue -  recently, I purchased a sex doll for my own use. It has a face, but it is clear that it is not a real human. I enjoy it more because, for me, it feels more real. However, gf freaked out and told me to get rid of it. I feel like this isn't fair to me - I spent a good chunk of money on it and its not exactly returnable, and to me it seems like its basically the same as the toys she uses. After all, she has a dildo and it certainly isn't shaped like my dick. \r\n\r\nAITA for not wanting to get rid of this?

But he constantly talks about the \"cool\" edgy stuff he does for attention, even if it doesn't really pertain to the conversation. (EX: once we were at a gaming event and were talking about a celebrity who got a DUI, and he loudly proclaimed that he did cocaine and likes to smoke the cigarette butts he finds in parking lots).  He's also mildly autistic, and constantly talks over people and interrupts them, probably because he doesn't realize it's rude (or doesn't care). He's also got this really weird sense of humor where he'll intentionally play dumb and addamantly use the wrong information and literally NOBODY knows how to respond to him  because it's not funny and results in arguing (at my last party he asked my friend what netflix was, and if it was the site owned by Mark Zucc where you order packages, or he'll say \"who's spongebob? that's the pink starfish man right? Spongebob?\"). He also doesn't really partake in any of the party activities (tried to get him to play Smash, he put the controller on the table and stood in the corner???), won't play party games unless it's CAH, is recovering from an eating disorder (I am trying to support him through this) so he never eats in front of people (there will be lots of food at my party), and blurts out weird shit for attention.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, there's another guy (20 yo) attending who he tried to punch and LITERALLY WRESTLED WITH IN MY LIVING ROOM the last time I invited both of them to hang with me, and they don't really get along.

We are close friends and typically get along very well. We both have college degrees- I am currently in graduate school while working 2 jobs, and she is currently working nearby. We recently moved to a new, smaller two bedroom apartment, which has been fine. Cut to a few weeks ago, when we found out that her grandmother has a form of liver cancer you get from drinking excessively over many years. This is obviously not an ideal situation, but her prognosis is very good and there is a large hospital in our city (around 45 minutes from where her grandmother lives).\r\n\r\nAt first, there was no problem- my roommate asked if her grandmother could stay overnight because they had an early doctor's appointment. No problem, it's totally understandable that she'd rather get a good night's sleep here than get up earlier and drive in. Fast forward to this week- where I was given one day's notice that her grandmother would be staying with us for an entire week while she gets a new kind of specialized treatment at the hospital nearby. She arrived early Sunday morning, and will not be leaving until tomorrow (Saturday). While I am sympathetic to her situation, I also think that this is excessive. I realize that not everyone is able to afford a hotel or an airbnb, but they do have other family members that live close by and would be happy to put her grandmother up for a few days. They have been loud and disruptive  when I come in the house and seem to leave behind a mess wherever they go. Staying the night here and there is one thing, but at this point it feels like I have gained the burden of another roommate without the benefit of lowered rent.\r\n\r\nMy finals are coming up and I spend almost every waking moment that I'm not working, studying. Every time I do come home (typically just to sleep), I have been coming home to a lot of noise and a mess, typically when it is already late and I have to be back at work in a few hours. I'm talking trash piling up in the kitchen, dishes in the sink, and a destroyed shower (I had to buy a new razor because one of them knocked it and the holder off the wall and just left it in a puddle in the bottom of the bathtub). Am I being unreasonable for finding this not only annoying, but disrespectful? I would never just assume that having a family member stay in my apartment for an extended period of time is okay without checking in with her first. I want to say something to her but am concerned that it will come off as insensitive given the circumstances.\r\n\r\nTLDR; my roommate's grandmother has been staying with us for a week and I've been cleaning up after both of them.

I (21M) am ethnically Indian even though I've lived my life in the U.S. and because of my parents being first generation immigrants, I have had a healthy mix of both Indian and American cultures in my life, which I am thankful for. My girlfriend (20F) is an extremely beautiful white American with blonde hair. We both met and are still in college in Northern California.\r\n\r\nSo, onto the story. For our two year anniversary, we decided to do a weekend trip to LA to go to Disneyland, something saved up for since we're still college students. \r\n\r\nHere's where the issue begins. Throughout the day at Disney, every time I walked past another Indian couple or group, I would be getting nasty stares. Fine, whatever, I love her and she loves me so I'm not going to let a few looks get inside my head too much, but still, it wasn't the best feeling in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in line for one of the rides with a longer than normal wait time, we had an Indian family right in front of us. There were the couple, and their two children, a guy who seemed to be high school age and a girl that seemed around middle school. \r\n\r\nImmediately, the wife noticed that I was holding my girlfriend's hand and shot me a look. I was kinda getting used to it at this point, but then she decided she wanted me to be an example to her children.\r\nIn Hindi (which I speak) she immediately went onto a rant about how I was what was wrong about Indians in America now and that she couldn't stand it. I noticed the boy was kinda worried and embarrassed and asked her in Hindi about what if I understood her, to which she said \"anyone like us that dates white women is a failure to our parents and can't speak Hindi\". At this point I was visibly upset, and my girlfriend noticed and asked what was wrong. I didn't want to get into it, especially because we've faced situations like this before and it leaves us both feeling shitty, something that I didn't want to take away from our trip. So I let it go.\r\n\r\nLater, back at our hotel, my girlfriend again asked me why I seemed so angry in that line, and after bugging me for a bit, I calmly explained it to her. She got upset at me that I wouldn't tell her, and thought that I didn't want to bring it up to her because I was embarrassed about dating her. She's quite upset with me at the moment, and I'm really wanting to explain it was because I didn't want to ruin our day at Disney, but she said she just wanted some space right now.

It\u2019s the most healthy relationship I have ever been in and she treats me very well. We have a lot in common and have great communication. We also both suffer from anxiety. Let me preface this by saying I have done a ton of work on my anxiety this year alone. My girlfriend has always been very supportive, and works on herself constantly.  My biggest phobia is flying. Last time I tried getting on a plane was 8 years ago. I panicked and pushed through people to get off of it (while on Xanax). Haven\u2019t wanted to do it again since. My girlfriend LOVES to travel. I enjoy getting out of town, and we do that a few times a month, sticking to surrounding cities and states. This is more than enough travel for me.

It has gotten beyond the point of merely an aesthetic issue, and I have genuine concerns about her health.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't live at home, as she recently started graduate school out of town. Our arrangement is that I pay for her tuition and rent, and she has a part time job that covers groceries, utility bills, spending money, etc. This works out well as I am happy to cover these expenses since she is in school. However, she often says that she wishes she earned more money, since she does not have a ton of spending money for leisure activities, clothes, etc.\r\n\r\nI have tried to speak to her about her weight, approaching it as delicately as I could. She was actually quite receptive, and I could tell she was a bit hurt but she told me that she knew it was an issue that she should be addressing. However, currently she is not sufficiently motivated to do it, and is busy with her school and part time job so struggles to find time to go to the gym. \r\n\r\nI suggested that if she started going to the gym, I would give her extra money. This is to serve as a motivator, but also for practical reasons as she can pick up fewer shifts at her job and have more time to go to the gym.\r\n\r\nThe deal is $15 per hour spent at the gym. This is working on an honour system since I trust her, and I did not think it would be appropriate to pay her by pounds lost (could encourage unhealthy eating and so on). My wife thinks this is a \"disgusting\" idea, but I think I am helping her by replacing her shifts at her job with \"shifts\" at the gym - and financially compensating this.\r\n\r\nSo, AITA for paying for my daughter to lose weight?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** A lot of comments about how her diet is the most important thing, rather than exercise. Which is definitely fair. We did also speak about her diet, but her lack of exercise is the facet that had the most clear barrier (lack of time and motivation) which is why that is what I am addressing.

My sister is 24. She was born with Prader Willi Syndrome. It's a severe disorder with complicated symptoms. In a nutshell: it's a hormonal imbalance that results from a chromosomal mutation that causes moderate cognitive delays, behavioral issues (temper tantrums, other outbursts, and sometimes even violence), and severe anxiety. It also causes insatiable hunger (due to the hormone imbalance, her body never feels 'full'). The hunger leads to an obsession with food, and morbid obesity.... which can make the behavioral problems even worse.\r\n\r\nPart of my sister's anxiety manifests in a severe FOMO. She's VERY insecure, and would get seriously upset when my parents were giving me some sort of special attention. Whether it was because I got a big part in a school play, a softball game, etc. she could not handle if I was center of attention. She'd often do things to sabotage the event so that my parents were forced to focus the attention back on her. For context, my sister operates on the same mental level as a 10 year old.\r\n\r\nWhen I moved away for college, she relaxed a bit because it meant she was getting almost full attention from my parents. But, that all backfired when I met my fiance. We got engaged a little over a year and a half ago. With all the excitement with the wedding and me starting my new family, it triggered something in my sister.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow, I have a hard time visiting home because my sister is obsessive over the newfound attention on me & my fiance.

But, I'm at the point where I don't even enjoy visits home because I know it will be difficult for me to spend any extended amount of time with just me and my parents. It's been years since I had a conversation with just the two of them, or did any activity with them. I don't want to be the bad guy with my sister regarding this (she doesn't understand the concept of these types of conversations, she automatically starts crying and believes you \"don't love her anymore\") , but it's getting to that point. I want to discuss my frustration with my parents, but since they are getting older and simply trying their best to take care of her, I feel guilty even doing that. They have enough on their plate, they don't have to worry about me being unhappy as well. But, I can't pretend this isn't really impacting me... it's become the norm for me to excuse myself while visiting home, go to my childhood room, and break down in tears because this has been going on for so long.

We are tentatively starting planning, but don't plan on getting married for at least a year and a half, maybe more. Our plan is to have a wedding ceremony/reception with 50 people (lots of venues charge less for under 50 people), doing a relatively extravagent honeymoon, then coming back and having a huge party with our entire extended family and friends. We are pretty nontraditional and plan to have a wedding that is relatively non-traditional too. Think Bilbo's 111st birthday in Lord of the Rings. That's the kind of vibe we're hoping for at both events.\r\n\r\nWe will be paying for our own wedding. There's a chance my parents will offer a chunk of money, but we might not even accept it because our income is higher than my parents'. I make good money as a data engineer, however I do have student loan debt and my fiance is chronically ill so he works as a homemaker instead so I'm the sole income earner. We keep a relatively strict budget but do fine, rent a nice 1 bedroom, spent a couple grand on a vacation this year (saved up for about 6 months to do it), etc. We are not relying on anyone else contributing money to our wedding or honeymoon and will plan and budget it as though we would get 0 help.\r\n\r\nWhat we are hoping to ask for, however, is non-monetary contributions. For instance, my aunt works at an upscale hotel, so we want to ask her if we can use her discount on hotel stays for the honeymoon (idk how those discounts work but I'm pretty sure that's a thing she can do). My fiance's cousin is a florist, and we are hoping to ask her for her services, offer to pay in full, but also ask her to consider giving us a discount instead of a wedding gift. Etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nI know how annoying it is when people ask friends and family for free services/products, but I figure if we a) make it clear we are willing to pay full price and b) tell them not to get a gift for us if they do, then it would still be respectful. We wouldn't ask for a specific price or percent discount, just \"a small discount\" off what they normally charge, after making it clear that full price is fine too. \r\n\r\nI feel awkward about this because we have higher income than a fair amount of the people we'd be asking this of, and I don't want to be one of *those* people. Strictly speaking, we don't *need* the help. But I figure if someone is tight on cash, then offering 10% off their services might be less of a burden than being expected to buy an actual gift. We have lived together for a few years already, we don't need a new dish set or curtains. We just want to save as much as possible on the wedding so we can have a more awesome honeymoon.\r\n\r\nAgain, this won't be an extravagant affair. Our hopeful budget is $10k for the wedding/reception and much less for the other party (we'd probably have that in a public park or something and have food trucks for catering, etc). Is this appropriate to ask of family/friends, or would this be tacky?"}, "1500": {"id": "cfxv61", "title": "AITA for being angry with my dad for not buying me a gaming PC.", "body": "Okay hear me out first. I sound like a 9 y/o. I (15M) and my brother (17M) have been saving money to buy a gaming PC since 2 years. Me and my brothers weren't allowed to have summer jobs and instead were forced to stay at home and study. We saved 500$ total. We got money by collecting Eidi (Eidi is basically money given to kids on Eid by relatives. It happens once a year.) So when we were able to get enough money to buy a gaming PC my dad refused to buy us a PC. He didn't straight up say no instead he took me to some PC shops to comfort me that he will buy me a PC from my money and then 2 days later I heard him saying to my mom that he will not buy me a PC from my money and will not let me or my brother bring PC into this house because my grades are C. When I heard this I blew up on my dad and started yelling at him.(didn't cuss). Then later cried myself to sleep. Since then I have been giving my dad the silent treatment.

L is 86 and is definitely feeling her age, she is fairly immobile and uses 2 walking sticks to get around places. She goes out a fair bit to do standard hobbies that old people do (bingo, gardening that kind of thing) but most of her time during the day consists of her watching TV and moving over to the kitchen to make food. This is where it gets kind of tricky.\r\n\r\nL is in the kitchen ALL the time, and by all the time I mean she is ALWAYS there making food or a cup of tea or something. This makes it incredibly hard to do your own thing in the kitchen because, as previously mentioned, L is quite immobile and so it takes forever for her to finish what she's doing. Both me and my Mother get pretty frustrated at this.\r\n\r\nMy Mother works 12 hour shifts throughout the week and so when she comes home and sees that L is making food or a cup of tea and that she won't be able to do anything in the kitchen until she's done she gets very frustrated. \r\n\r\nShe also gets frustrated because L also kind of assumes that my Mother is going to go shopping for her or take her to her Doctor appointments on her days off. Like she'll just be like \"I've wrote a shopping list for you\" or \"My appointment is at x time\" and because my Mother is such a kind soul she won't refuse but instead just do it without question and get frustrated about it. \r\n\r\nWhat's also frustrating is that L won't wait for people to be done before she comes into the kitchen, she has a VERY specific schedule for what time she eats and so if someone is in there at that time she will come in and start doing her thing and quite frankly just get in the way of what you're trying to do. It's frustrating to the point where I'll just straight up leave the kitchen until she's done before I continue.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that L is a very nice lady but that there's just some I guess 'unspoken conflict' between who is in what space at what time. So my question to you Reddit is: WIBTA if I were to talk about this with L to try and make things a little less frustrating for my Mother and I? I've spoke to some friends about this and they've said that I would be an asshole for bringing it up and that I should just put up with it because she's old and slow so I'm not sure if I should or not.

Recently she has started using Instagram a bit more as she didn't post much for a while and has been uploading more sexually suggestive posts such as 'Ahegoa' poses with hashtags to go with it, therefore increasing the reach of her photos. There have been a lot of comments coming in that from other males that make me a bit uncomfortable to read.

She's very extroverted so historically, I've been supportive of this and am proud she sought different outlets for personal growth.\r\n\r\nLately, with the kids getting older and requiring more, and my work becoming more stressful and demanding since I'm the sole financial provider, my thoughts on her working \"for personal satisfaction\" have changed.

We  have to split more of the household chores between the two of us, despite the fact that I work full-time and she only works part-time, but she gets worn out more easily (I feel like I have enough on my plate already). We buy takeout often, we have a maid instead of cleaning, etc. All these add to our financial burdens (therefore my personal stress and # of work hours) because her job pays so little (about 10% of our household earnings).\r\n\r\nShe's recently started complaining about her job being draining and stressful, to which I angrily think, \"Well then, why are you choosing to spend your time on it?\" Because she's more tired, she's also been sleeping in more, leaving me to wake up and take care of most of the morning activities. I feel tired, too. I would really like to sleep in but that doesn't feel like an option since she's worn out.\r\n\r\nHere's the long and short of it: I feel like her job is nothing but a liability.
