My brother is 7 years younger than me, so it's already a decent sized age gap between us.  We managed to get along fairly well as kids because we were both still children and had interests in video games, I suppose.  He's my half-brother, same mom but different dads.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI also have a sister through my dad who just turned 6 in February.  And honestly, the more I think through it, the more I just don't really want a relationship with her.

My little sister (21F) immediately demanded that I take her with me on my next international trip, which I\u2019m not a fan of for various reasons.\r\n\r\n1. She would slow me down and end up costing me more money. I like to travel light (I bring only a carry on and one small daypack as my personal item on flights), but she is a heavy packer and would bring large luggage, which of course she would have to check for flights and slow me down at airports if there are connecting flights. I am also someone who prefers to stay in hostels since I can save money on accommodation and also socialize with other travelers. She would never do this - she is a hotel only kind of person. She went on a trip to Tybee Island, GA with her ex-bf a year ago and spent almost as much money on a hotel for the two of them for four nights as I did on my accommodations in Greece for nine nights. Plus, she would not want to socialize with people in a hostel. \r\n\r\n2. Our interests are very different. I enjoy trying new things and really experiencing local culture - off the beaten path kind of things, local food, local nightlife scene, outdoors activities like hiking if the destination permits, etc. She likes to stick to the touristy things and really likes to shop. I don\u2019t mind some shopping but I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of my time that way. She is also a picky eater and I can\u2019t see her being down to try a lot of different foods abroad. She doesn\u2019t like going out/drinking at all either, but it\u2019s something I like to do if the location allows.\r\n\r\n3. Despite being 21, she acts like she\u2019s 16. She\u2019s really volatile and the littlest things tend to set her off with no warning - she will become completely insufferable and not fun to be around. I\u2019m afraid that if I travel with her and she gets into one of her moods, it will ruin part of the trip. This has happened before on a family trip to Myrtle Beach and my whole family was affected by it.\r\n\r\n4. She tends to be prejudiced toward people of different backgrounds, especially people of color. Which makes me wonder why she even wants to travel at all?\r\n\r\nOverall, I just don\u2019t think our personalities and travel styles mesh together to make an international trip work or be satisfying for both of us. However, when I inevitability start to plan my next trip I know that my parents and her would have something negative to say if I didn\u2019t include her... Especially if I decide to go somewhere with a friend who has the same travel style as me. Going on a trip with her would be a gamble and lot of money to spend for me to not get what I wanted out of it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to me since we are both adults and should be able to live separate lives. I don\u2019t think I should have to include her in something as big/financially taxing as international travel if I didn\u2019t want to.\r\n\r\nWIBTA if I told her I just didn\u2019t want to take a big trip with her if it came down to it?"}, "1010": {"id": "d40o85", "title": "AITA for not telling my parents medical info?", "body": "Fair warning: gonna be talking about cancer and stuff, so be aware if that's a sensitive topic for you.\r\nOk, so I (23F) had a physical the other day and part of it was a manual breast exam. Breast cancer runs rampant in my family (mom had it at 30, her mom had it at 40) and I have the same BRCA mutation my mom does. Long story short, the doc found a lump that I had found about 2 months before, except when the doc found it, it was super tender (maybe she was pushing a lot harder than me? but I was literally crying it hurt so bad). I'm going in next week for an ultrasound (can't have a mammo when you're under 30, breast tissue is too dense).\r\n\r\nHere's where the problem begins: I haven't told my parents about the lump. I told them I had the physical, and that the doc wants to do a screening just to get another baseline imaging done (I did the same thing when I turned 18 and found out I had the mutation). \r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to tell them the truth because:\r\n1. It could literally be nothing, just hormonal breast sensitivity (the fact alone that the lump hurts means it's probably not cancer)\r\n2. There's still a lot of unprocessed emotion/trauma for my parents and family from when my mom had cancer. Every time the phrase \"breast cancer\" even gets mentioned, my mom gets all zoned out. It took a year of me, my father, and multiple docs convincing my mother to let me get the genetic testing done (when having the mutation doesn't even guarantee that you'll have it, just your chances are statistically higher). I'm terrified that mentioning this lump alone to my parents (mother especially) will make them super depressed. I know it's not my responsibility for how they receive or process the news, but given that I'm currently living with them, that'll make my (unrelated) depression (that I've had since middle school) worse too. \r\n\r\nWhat I will tell them will depend on the results of the ultrasound. If it's nothing, I'll tell them nothing. If there's something, or a biopsy needs to be done I'll tell them (and hope they can figure out their emotional issues regarding it).\r\n\r\nTl;dr: I have a potentially cancerous lump in my boob and haven't told my parents yet because of lack of info about what it actually is, and because of their emotional states regarding the whole breast cancer thing.\r\n\r\nAITA for not telling them anything about this lump yet? Or should I be telling them everything and every detail as it happens (which seems like an unnecessary emotional hell)?\r\n\r\nEdit: thank you so much everyone!

Oh and my parents just invested most of their savings to buy a new house and they'd been tellin my that they have financial issues since then. \r\n\r\nSo this is where my problem begins, I have never needed extra coaching or tuitions but my dad enrolled me for one and I have to go there. This basically makes its so that 5 days a week I leave my home at 7:30 am and come back after 9 pm with only around 2 hours of breaks (including the time it takes to commute). I did attend the first few lectures sincerely and tried to pay attention to what was being taught, but I literally cannot.

Well on the first day I notice a girl around my age in a shirt with my school logo on it, so I take the seat next to her and get to talking. She's a student there also, same year as me. She's really nice and really funny, not to mention she was adorable imo. So at the end of the week after class gets out, I muster up the courage to ask her out. She politely declines, saying that while she's single, she isn't really interested in getting into a relationship at the moment. She would love however to be friends with me as she's enjoyed talking with me over the past week. Fair enough. I was disappointed, of course, but you can't win every time can you?\r\n\r\nWe remain friendly / friends while in class and once a few weeks go by, actually started hanging out outside of class. She was lots of fun to talk with and getting to know her was honestly one of the peaks of my summer - it was nice having someone from my school to hang with in my pretty boring town, plus we had a ton in common. But here's where it may get asshole-ish and where you should know something about me. I'm a pretty straightforward guy. If I'm interested in someone I go for it, and if they're not interested in me I accept it and force myself not to think about that person in a romantic context anymore. This technique helps minimize the pain of any potential rejection and forces me to move on and get on with my life. Call it a defense mechanism or whatever, but once someone I'm interested in declines the advance, I respect their views and my feelings fade soon after.

She says she's been thinking about me and our friendship and has enjoyed getting to know me.

I was so shocked I guess that I stuttered out a quick \"No, I don't think so but thank you.\" I could see how her whole demeanor drooped so I tried explaining what I said above and how I just didn't view her from that angle anymore. She wanted us to be friends and I was happy with that. She was quiet and said she understood but left shortly after.

I said well, it is a difficult one, but you cannot force a women to abort a baby if she doesnt want it as it is her body. In that moment it is my decision, and if I decide to have it while knowing very well that the baby is not wanted by the father and I am hurting you by this and ruining your life and very likely our relation, it is still my decision.

But then she asked me whether I was an only child or something and I pointed out I'm actually one of 8 children and come from a large family (8 children including me, lived with parents and grandparents) then she seemed really shocked, because the only other picture in my living room was a pic of me on a motorbike.\r\n\r\nI didn't think anything of it until she pointed it out. I met her through one of my friends (29M) and when I spoke to him, he said that the painting thing made me seem like an asshole to her. AITA?"}, "1022": {"id": "bynopg", "title": "AITA for deciding not to tell my family that the surgery I'm getting will probably kill me?", "body": "I'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It's 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and I'm following all the rules. So let's say my chances of dying are 60%. That's not great but not too horrible.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that I've had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.\r\n\r\nMy family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F) who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like I'm her little boy. The only reasons I could think of to tell them would be:\r\n\r\n1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don't think this is something they can prepare for. I'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. I don't want that.\r\n2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because I might die soon. It would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and I'd be unhappy because I would know they're miserable.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards \"ignorance is bliss\" for everyone involved. If I survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. And with My Medical Condition (TM) it's unlikely I'd make it to retirement age anyway.\r\n\r\nBut is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? What are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nEDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nEdit2: I've already gone over how I'd want my body dealt with the last time I had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). I have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.\r\n\r\nEdit3: I will write letters to them.\r\n\r\nEdit4: Maybe I wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. I'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. They're going to come see me off and we'll say our I love yous and good lucks at the hospital.\r\n\r\nEdit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this surgery.\r\n\r\nAnd YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You're all very sweet for wishing me well. It turns out Reddit isn't as scary as I feared (I just joined and this is my first post).\r\n\r\nEdit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don't know what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained.

After reading over 100 of these comments I don't know what I should do anymore. I'm feeling guilty for hiding this but I can't see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn't* a right thing to do.\r\n\r\nSo many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one.

The main reason for that was her depression. I know how horrible it may sound breaking up with someone because of mental illness, but her depression made her really dependant on me to the point where apart from uni, she was the only person I had social contact with. Living together didn't help. She was anxious about my every move or word even though I've always tried to calmly reassure her that she has nothing to worry about. It finally reached a point where I  was walking on eggshells every time I talked to her, I calculated my words and dodged topics just to avoid triggering an emotional reaction. I tried pushing her to get a therapist, but it didn't work. It felt like she was dragging me together with her, as every day I felt shittier and more unmotivated than the day before. Soon I realised that I can't carry my own emotional baggage and be someone's constant cry pillow at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen I broke up with her, I told her that I don't want to cut her out of my life completely, because she was still very much dear to me and that I'll want her to update me on her mental well being. But I made it very clear that we will probably never get back together.\r\n\r\nSince the break up, all I could think of when I thought about her was all the good times we had, it seemed like all the toxic parts of the relationship were nonexistent. But I always come back to my senses when I remember how terrible I was feeling towards the end. Because of this I decided that it would be best to stop talking to her at least until I'm fully over the relationship because I knew I had a big chance of relapsing if I didn't.\r\n\r\nIn the past two months since the break-up we texted a few times, but only about generic stuff such as who gets the speaker, wardrobe, etc because I'm moving out. A few weeks back I received a very long message from her explaining her point of view and how she already feels way better and was wondering if I was willing to get back together. I declined, but said that I was very very happy for her.\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, she texted me this \"I wanted to ask you why haven't you said a word to me, why are you avoiding me and pretend that I don't even exist? We had  been together for 2 years, we don't have to get back together, but I was hoping that you at least cared about me a tiny bit, because I've tried texting you. So I just wanted to ask.\" \r\n\r\nI realised that I failed my promise of keeping her in my life, but I also feel like I made the right decision.

My sister has had 2, the first was more her whiny choosing for a Nissan Altima (despite our dad telling her they aren\u2019t usually the best and cost more to fix) and then a few months after having that she got her 2013 fusion, which she has now had for about 3 years. \r\nThis argument through text caused my mom to call me and gripe.

I live at home, with my parents (expected to really. I live in an Asian household (brown)). I don't have a job, nor have I held one for a while, to focus on college. Whatever money I have in my bank account, I get through the school, and it's not much. I have around $6k saved up, which I consider my emergency fund that I dip into for whatever, train fare, food, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are...tensions in my family so to speak. I don't get along with my dad too well, as he tries to force everything on me. I know it sounds entitled, probably is since I'm living on his generosity, but when I say force I mean there is no room for me to say anything. He is always right, and I can't hold an opinion, and if I do, it's disregarded or made fun of down the line. I guess he would count as a narcissist parent :/ . It's either listen to him 100% or he gets super red faced angry, and I either have to listen or choose to leave the house.\r\n\r\nBecause of that I think I may end up getting kicked out at one point or another, so I've been saving my money to create an emergency fund of around $6k+. Not even enough to addord rent for a year. \r\n\r\nI'm super hesitant to spend large amounts of money $50+ even for myself, unless it's important. \r\n\r\nCue today. My mom doesn't really work.  If I have to be honest, I think she's bitter at her life and there are tensions between her and my dad. I feel bad for her, 100%.\r\n\r\nShe gets spending money from my dad.\r\nToday she didn't have much on her because she left the house after having an argument with my dad. \r\n\r\nShe asked me twice, if I would pay for her clothes. The first time I thought she was joking, but I guess not.\r\n\r\nI hesitated for a moment too long, and she got upset. No tantrum, just upset. She called me stingy, and that I'd never buy anything for her. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to feel really. The rational side of me is saying $50 is too much for someone who lives off of his meager emergency fund and doesn't have any job or anything. Heck I rarely spend upwards of $25 on much, even when outside getting food with friends.\r\n\r\nBut, the emotional side of me is ashamed. She doesn't work, and has no income of her own (she's looking for a job now actually). \r\n\r\nI told her that I don't have a job, that I consider it an emergency fund of sorts. I even mentioned the getting kicked out part. Her reaction wasn't any different. She was disappointed that I'd ever \"leave them\".

My wife and I share a lot of things and have a generally great relationship. I do my fair share around the household and anything she is asking for. 5 years ago, my wife decided that she wanted to live in the countryside and I reluctantly agreed. This meant I had a 4-5 hour commute for my job. I tried to have a tiny flat in town to reduce commuting to weekends.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI have to say that I've never been unfaithful in any relationship and I don't ever flirt with other women either.

So the flat was not really an option. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nCommuting became too much for me and 2 years ago, after 13 years of a decent career I decided to try freelancing.

My first client was very much on the balls and testing my work regularly with deadlines. But my current client is in no rush to get work delivered.  I can only fairly charge about 3-5 hours a day as I get distracted for the rest of the time. This is still more than my past salary, but I could earn a lot more if I could force myself to focus for more time as the one thing there is plenty of is demand. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI occasionally hire other people online for jobs I don't want to do myself.

I'd pay her to test work I've done and nag me to get it done. The issue is, that this would only work because I would really not want to let her down and there is a sort of emotional aspect to this. She has no 'seniority' leverage, is not a client or boss. So the only way this would work is on the basis of adding a the social aspect to this exchange that you tend to have with other co-workers in a normal work environment where you just don't want to let them down and where a promise to 'get X out for you by Y' has some emotional responsibility cost attached. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI don't usually tell my wife who I hire and she has no interest in this. But in this case, I am pretty sure she'd feel immediately jealous if she found out. So if I told her, she would ask me to stop working with this person. But if I did not tell her I'd be able to earn about 60-70% more every day even after paying this tester. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWIBTA if I continued this working relationship and move it more to a tester/reviewer/nagger role but did not tell my wife about it."}, "1039": {"id": "bz5wzr", "title": "AITA for not thinking a kids outdated memes are funny?", "body": "So I am in a teenage play, right?

We had a small intimate ceremony attended by the closest people in our lives. On my side, this was my mom (single mom, so dad wasn't there) and my 7 closest friends, some of whom I have known since middle school/high school. On her side, it was her family which was around 22 people.\r\n\r\nWe had a wedding photographer take pictures throughout our wedding. He was really thoughtful and great to work with! Throughout our wedding day, he made sure to get individual photos of us with our important people. For example, we have photos of us posing with my group of friends, us with her immediate family, us with her extended family, us with my mom, etc. Overall, it was a very positive experience and I couldn't be happier that we were able to share it with this group of people in our lives.\r\n\r\nAfter the wedding, my friends who attended the wedding expressed several times that they couldn't wait to see the wedding photos that have them in the shot (eg. our group shots). So after our photographer sent us all our finished wedding photos, I went through them to pick out the photos that have my friends in them and sent them to my friends (edit: they were digital copies of the photos, which I sent via email). They were super excited to be able to see the final shots.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI was chatting with my wife and brought up the fact that I had sent my friends the photos. She got *really* upset which I was very taken aback by. She asked me why I would do something like that and that it sucks that I sent them the photos.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe talked it out and ultimately, this is her perspective: 1) She thinks it\u2019s highly abnormal for couples to send photos from their wedding to friends. She expected from the beginning that we would not send the photos to anyone and would only share them by posting on our own social media. 2) She feels that she looked ugly in all except two of the photos, so she hates the fact my friends now have some photos that include her in the shot.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy perspective was that I think it\u2019s very normal for couple to send photos of their wedding to friends, especially because these are the same friends of mine who attended our wedding. She\u2019s mentioned in the past that she thinks she looked ugly in the photos (which I always refute), but she\u2019s also posted our wedding photos on her social media, she\u2019s showed the pictures to her family/my mom, and our photographer & his affiliates have promoted our photos on social media. So it also never even occurred to me that sending the photos to my friends would be any different from posting them on social media ourselves.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve already talked it out and resolved it, but we are wondering AITA for sending the pics to them?\u00a0"}, "1062": {"id": "b3pmdr", "title": "AITA for making my partner return his new computer?", "body": "TLDR: My (30F) live-in partner (40M) of 6 years told me he was dreaming about a brand-new high-end gaming computer. He has no savings, and he already has plenty of entertainment options, so I wanted him to wait. But I also said I couldn't dictate what he should spend his money on - especially since I've been relying on him financially. TIL that he already bought it without telling me and got pretty upset. Seeing my reaction, he said he would return it. AITA if he does?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo, my partner has had a good, high-income job for the entire time we've been together. But he has also acted very irresponsibly with his finances - frivolous spending, unpaid bills, credit card debt and unpaid debt to his relatives, to the point where they had a severe conflict over it.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI was mostly kept in the dark about this and assumed everything was OK since he had a house and no bank loan. Once aware, I did my best to help him. At the same time, I've felt a lot of guilt about not been able to contribute my fair share - first due to being a student, recently due to unemployment. He's never made it into an issue though, and I'm very grateful for that.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAlthough there's been setbacks and lies about his level of financial control, we're doing a lot better now. He's paying his bills, no real debt etc. Spending has gone down, although we live very comfortably. I recently got a job so our situation will improve even more soon. However, it's not been more than 2-3 months since our last financial crisis, which had to be resolved by a loan. This happens because he does not save money, and because I've not had an income to share the burden.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo when he started talking about getting a brand new, high-end gaming laptop I was a bit weary. He bought a new gaming computer 3 years ago and hardly ever uses it. But we often play games on PS4, at times on our PCs too, and we have more games than time to play.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThus I didn't see the need for a new one ATM - especially because we'll soon be able to save up for a buffer and plan purchases, save for holidays and make much-needed improvements on the house. But he went behind my back and bought it anyway. I was fairly shocked and upset when he told me, and I still am. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nFrom his POV, he got such a good deal on this computer, half price on 4k, that he just had to get it. \"Now or never\", and it's been his dream to own a computer like this. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's a very kind person, and I believe him when he says that he wouldn't mind if I spent a similar sum on myself. He's happy living paycheck to paycheck - until it's crisis mode again. I'm so tired of the stress. But given that we're moving into a better financial situation, the crises hopefully won't happen anymore. Plus, maybe I'm overreacting to him treating himself after working hard because of our background on this topic.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe did get a good deal, and I sort-of feel like the asshole for letting him return it.

My other friends are people I met on my gap year, let\u2019s call them Mary (18F), Harold (18M) and Nelly (17F). \r\n\r\nMe and Mary are kinda together (casual relationship that we aren\u2019t labelling since I\u2019m leaving to uni so soon). Oscar is starting uni again soon but has nowhere to stay before, so he has been staying at my house for the past 3 days. This was kind of short notice.\r\n\r\nBasically I try to mix these friend groups sometimes because I feel they get on pretty well, and we always have a lot of fun, and they\u2019re both really good friends of mine. Oscar has hung out with me, Harold and Mary a bunch of times and it has always been super fun. \r\n\r\nToday we all went to a water park, and it was a lot of fun. This had already been planned for a while with my new friend group, but since Oscar was staying with me, I said he should come. Oscar had already hung out with them lots of times and they got on well. Since Oscar was coming, I also invited Sean. Sean had never met them.\r\n\r\nThe plan after was to all go for dinner together, and then go to Harold\u2019s house and hang out. \r\n\r\nAfter the water park, before we went for dinner, Sean says he needs to go home to take his brother to my house (to hang out with my brother). He suggests my high school friend group (Me and Oscar) should go with him and then we can hang at mine, and they can smoke some weed. I say I can\u2019t because I\u2019d already said to my other friends that we were going for dinner, and then to Harold\u2019s. Both Oscar and Sean were invited to this of course. I was Mary, Harold and Nelly\u2019s lift, so I had to go with them to Harold\u2019s anyway. I suggested if he really wanted to do that, he could hang with my brother (16M) and his brother (17M) (since we all get on quite well), and that id join him later when I got back from Harold\u2019s. Oscar said he\u2019d go with Sean and not with me to Harold\u2019s.\r\n\r\nSo they left, and then ended up back at my house. I went with Mary, Nelly and Harold to Harold\u2019s house. \r\n\r\nSean and Oscar end up back at mine alone, and I feel bad that I\u2019ve left them, so I really want to go back home, but I felt bad for leaving Harold\u2019s house as well, because I was taking Nelly and Mary home, so if I leave. they have to leave too. I don\u2019t want to ruin the hang out, and make everyone go home.\r\n\r\nMy mum calls me up and says it\u2019s so bad that I\u2019ve just left them alone at my house and I\u2019m not even there. She gets pissed off at me and calls it weird and awkward for her and my dad to host them when I\u2019m not there. I told them they don\u2019t have to do anything and that my friends are fine just hanging out and chilling upstairs.\r\n\r\nI tell my friends that if they smoke weed, to make sure my parents don\u2019t find out and don\u2019t see them high. But my parents find out about it. They text me and say things were awkward at my house. I\u2019m really stressed about this, so this is when I rush home from Harold\u2019s to look after them and make sure things are fine at my house. I get back from Harold\u2019s at 10:30, and they are both baked af. \r\n\r\nNow my parents are pissed of at me, because apparently I\u2019m \u201cselfish\u201d for not going with my friends and for staying so long at Harold\u2019s house and leaving Oscar and Sean alone at mine. I\u2019m apparently choosing \u201cfriends I just met over ones I\u2019ve had for ages\u201d. My mum also called my friend Harold \u201cweird\u201d and says she doesn\u2019t know why I call him one of my best friends.\r\n\r\nShe was really mad and we had a huge argument.

We were both set to graduate this past May.\r\n\r\nI successfully completed my bachelor's, but he did not. To make a long story short, he was screwed over by the first advisor he had at his university. He switched to a different advisor halfway through. This new advisor found out about two months before graduation that my fiance hadn't taken all the classes he needed for his degree. They quickly figured out that it was because the previous advisor helped make his schedules and assured him he was on track to graduate on time, even though he wasn't. Since his major is required by a national association to include a particular set of classes, there was no way the university could allow him to graduate regardless of the shitty situation.\r\n\r\nSince he was already in a lot of student debt and his dream job is with the current company he works for and is attainable without a degree, my fiance decided that he would not go on to finish school, but plans to finish in the future by taking classes online with a different school.\r\n\r\nHis brother (22m) graduated the same day as my fiance and I.

He's afraid of disappointing them, and the fact that his brother DID graduate definitely doesn't help this fear.

I told him that I wouldn't lie for him and if anyone asked, I would redirect it to him. However, sometimes when I'm alone with my parents and they talk about it I obviously can't do that.

TLDR at the bottom. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe friend, Mary and my boyfriend Arthur met years ago, before Mary came out. They have known one another for years. \r\n\r\nMary and Arthur were part of an all-male friend group, who were very close knit. When I first met the group, when we were all 16/17ish and starting our A-Levels the group dynamic was pretty set. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is A Lot of casual flirting. The guys would all flirt with one another and I would flirt with all of them.  Nobody meant anything by it, if anybody asked anyone to stop then they would right away and there was a general respect for boundaries. \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this time one of the established members of the group, Terry, began dating a newcomer, Sophie. Everybody except Arthur stopped flirting with them immediately - they were in a relationship so it became off limits. Arthur would still make some jokes with Terry, but only after making sure it was fine with Sophie first. \r\n\r\n\r\nFast forward five years. We have collectively fallen out of contact with Mary, and see less of one another as we split up for University, but otherwise the group dynamic is unchanged. Terry and Sophie are still together, and Arthur and I have now been dating for three and a half years. \r\n\r\nRecently, Mary has come back into our lives. She has publicly come out, and now dresses and lives as a woman. Arthur and I met her for coffee not long ago, and while we were there, she went right back into the joke flirting dynamic. And I was Very Uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nI felt like a third wheel, and like my boyfriend, who happily flirted back, was flirting with an attractive woman in public, right in front of me. I know that I would have no problem with it were Mary still presenting as male. I felt left out of the conversation, like I couldn\u2019t join in or interrupt. \r\n\r\nThis is where I need to know if I\u2019m the asshole. Mary will be moving near us soon, and, while I\u2019m excited to see more of her, I don\u2019t want to feel like a third wheel again. Would I be the asshole if I raised this with Arthur before we see her again and asked that he talk with Mary about toning down the flirting? It never bothered me when Mary presented as Mark, and it doesn\u2019t bother me when our other male friends do it, so does this double standard make me an asshole? I feel like I\u2019m totally overreacting and don\u2019t want to make a thing of this if I\u2019m being too sensitive.\r\n\r\nTLDR;  friend group has flirty dynamic, I don\u2019t mind other men joke flirting with my boyfriend but I am uncomfortable when our MtF transgender friend does this because he is now flirting with another woman and I get jealous and insecure and feel left out of the conversation as it becomes between the two of them.

My plan was to work as many hours as I could handle over the summer to save money so I can work fewer hours during college (it usually starts in the end of August). \r\n  I got an interview with a big company in July that paid me well. They only offered a full-time job and I knew it wouldn\u2019t work with my school schedule. I  didn\u2019t tell the interviewer that I was going to work for them for only a month and got hired. I worked there July - August and quit. During this time, I enjoyed my job, made friends and saved money.

I got on the rear delt machine, which faces away from the rest of the weight room so that when you're sitting down at it, you get a view of an empty hallway, but can't see anyone else entering the weight room.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: I use my phone's stopwatch to time my rests between sets. I don't use any apps except for my stopwatch and I leave it sitting on my lap during rests. I was getting tired so I gave myself a full three minute rest before my last set. As I'm putting my phone away an old man (75?M) cranes his neck over my shoulder and says \"Are you going to be on your cell phone for much longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was using it as a timer. Did you want to use this machine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well I'm about to start my last set--\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay--\"\r\n\r\n\"You could've asked politely.\" \r\n\r\n\"--I'll work on something else.\"\r\n\r\nHe then disappeared for however long it took me to do my set, came over, did one quick set and went home.\r\n\r\nHere's the case against me as I see it: it's very possible he perceived me to be using my phone to dick around while hogging the machine. The mitigating factors that work in my favor, that the phone was sitting untouched in my lap and that it was using the stopwatch feature, are nuances that are likely lost on him. I'm making a guess here, but since he called it a \"cell phone\" (which I associate with elderly people who are intimidated by smartphones and primed for anti-millennial-phone-use sentiment) I think he earnestly believed me to be dicking around. Then he comes up to me and calls me on it and when he's corrected and responds in a somewhat nicer tone I snidely chastise him, a grown-ass adult man who's just trying to get home.\r\n\r\nBecause he came up right at the end of the rest period before my last set and because I can have no idea whether he was watching me because of the position of the machine, it's possible he could've waited while watching me sit on my ass doing nothing but glance at my phone every couple of seconds for a full three minutes. It was late and close to closing time (\\~30 minutes away). Since he left after his set, it makes me think I was the only obstacle standing between him and getting out of the gym to enjoy the rest of his Friday night.\r\n\r\nThe case against him as I see it: *He could've asked politely*. Even if I had been dicking around and had multiple sets left, I would've gladly worked him into my rotation. I thought the weight room was empty. Whether his perception is justified or not, he still made an assumption that I was dicking around and therefore phrased his question in a really snotty way.

I say this in the most endearing way possible, I love that kid so much but he drives everyone nuts by running around, regular kid behaviour. I don't think he is the worst kind of wanderer there is, my cousin often lets him run around in public spaces, but within a small distance. Or that used to be the case, idk. Three days ago we were all at the mall, and he is hit with a streak of independence and decides he wants to run down the escalator (that was coming up). We were obviously close enough to catch him and we did. The same day he decided to run into a crowd, and he purposefully ran to places he knew he shouldn't (because we keep saying no, don't go there). \r\n\r\nAnyway, we're all at home eating in the living room later and talking and the subject of my nephew's adventure streak comes up. My cousin's talking about how annoying it is and that she can't do anything when she's out with him, she has to pay attention to only him. He's at the age where he wants to do everything independently so he hates prams and that hanger thingy you use to hang your kid in the front or back of your chest. \r\n\r\nIt was a lighthearted discussion and I offhandedly suggested she could try one of those leashes for kids. One cousin laughed and suddenly shut up because everyone in the room kinda went weirdly silent, and my cousin (the mom) laughed it off but you could tell it was still awkward for her. We moved on, but I felt bad, partly because I didn't mean it entirely as a joke. I thought it was the end of it but my sister told my mom on call about what happened, expecting my mom to laugh as well, except my mom called me up and yelled at me. She said it was derogatory to suggest a leash for a kid and that I'm not even that close to everyone as they all are because we live away and see each other only twice a year or so, so I shouldn't have said anything like that. \r\n\r\nIdk dudes, I don't see her point since I don't think it's derogatory and some kids absolutely need that shit, but I agreed to apologise to my cousin anyway.

Honestly that broke me. She was the love of my life. I had never cared about one person so much. Since she broke up with me I\u2019ve been having a lot of mental issues. I\u2019m constantly depressed, I can\u2019t be in the same room as my ex without panicking. My life has been hell since we broke up. I don\u2019t talk about it to anyone besides a girl I\u2019ll call emma. She is my ex\u2019s best friend, and we became good friends while I was dating my ex. She is honestly the only thing keeping me alive. \r\n\r\nA few months ago my good friends younger sister contacted me out of the blue. Her name is Jamie. I got the vibe that she was interested in me, but I couldn\u2019t, and still can\u2019t, manage a relationship, especially with my friends sister, who I am not attracted to. Weeks went by, and every once in a while we talked. She had not actually told me that she was interested at this point. Eventually I started talking about my mental state, slowly sharing a bit more over time. I trusted her, and it seemed like she really did care about me. \r\n\r\nDuring one of these conversations she told me that I should talk with my ex about how I feel. I absolutely did not want to do that. I\u2019ve tried, and it seems like my ex would rather just forget the relationship happened. I\u2019ve given up on talking to her in general. Now a few minutes later, my ex texts me. This isn\u2019t too rare. Every once in a while we talk for a little bit. So we talked about random stuff. Christmas of all things. I wasn\u2019t feeling too bad, and I could tell I was making her laugh. Eventually she tells me that she texted me because Jamie said she was worried about me. I didn\u2019t want to talk to my ex about how depressed I am these days so I denied it. She believed me, told me goodnight then went to bed. Meanwhile I texted Jamie saying that what she did was an asshole move. She just said she thought it would help. She didn\u2019t even apologize. I told her that I don\u2019t trust her anymore, and she said I was being an asshole then blocked me. I think what I said was perfectly reasonable.

Her job is support/service and some of the stressful times with terrible people causes her to be emotionally exhausted (lots of ppl take out their frustration on support/service workers) and since Im an engineer at a different company I get it. \r\n\r\nSince we're in Illinois lots of \"hello there darling\" or \"hi little lady.\" She describes how tough it is and I help her deal with it. I once made a joke about \"do you not have work friends?\"\r\n\r\nWell she took my joke a bit seriously and started befriending two dudes that work with her. (I guess I hoped she'd find a close female bff). Ryan is one of them and they work closely for 8 hrs a day. During the stressful moments she'd call me after and she tells me how supportive/helpful I am. Recently she speaks about how helpful Ryan has been. She has mentioned how they've eaten together and she has bought him food and such. In addition, we are watching now an anime Ryan and Jim(another coworker) watch. She also mentioned Ryan has a girlfriend who he is considering proposing to.

She even texted me during the call??\r\n\r\nI guess it just bothers me that she is getting closer to a male colleague. She has often lied in the past about related things (she once met an old colleague for a work thing and told me they were just friends, but later it slipped they had a dating history). I realize that she is a female in an engineering firm so she will have to deal with men.\r\n\r\nKey point is my trust in her is really low. I guess because of past betrayal, I'm hyper aware and trying to nip anything in the bud before it happens. There is also the fact she has dated or been involved with 3 coworkers/employees from that company before and has lied about it at first or hid texts in the past also make me nervous. She has emotionally cheated early during our dating phase.\r\n\r\nThis morning I just mentioned that Id like it if she could create some distance between her and her coworker Ryan. Do some combination of: eat less together, put headphones on, socialize less, take breaks away from the desk and walk separately to the shuttle.\r\n\r\nWhen I said all this she seems exasperated and said you wanted me to have friends at work. He's dating someone. She said she'd try to tell me somethings she doesnt like about him. I just replied saying, \"Look this is how I feel and I am not accusing you, but would love if you could make an effort to distance yourself and make me feel more at ease.\"\r\n\r\nEDIT: Emotional Cheating: Sending \"I miss what we had\" or \"I still love you\" to an ex, but not doing anything physical or sexual.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: If I feel a certain way about a certain person - is it emotional maturity to shove it down or voice concerns early on?

I recently sold my house and was looking for a home to rent and it just made more sense to stay at his fathers house which is vacant than to sign a long term lease or buy another house right away. His dads house was not taken care of at all. The porch is rotting off, the toilets are broken, the house has mold growing In places; nastiness and hoard everywhere. I\u2019ve been steadily cleaning the home but it\u2019s still so much. I will mention that he has been working toward helping remove clutter and garbage from the home when he\u2019s in a week out of the month. He acts as if this is normal, though. He\u2019s even okay inviting friends over. Like, this is how things are and doesn\u2019t really seem too preoccupied by its condition. Mind you, this home was build 15 years ago by his father. It shouldn\u2019t be having these types of issues - it simply was **not** maintained. \r\n\r\nI get that everyone has different levels of cleanliness, but this really worries me that we could have fundamentally different perceptions/expectations of what clean is. I also have zero hoard tendencies and I\u2019m a bit of a clean freak. So, I can\u2019t seem to understand how someone lets their parents home get in this condition? I get that he doesn\u2019t live here and this wasn\u2019t his home, but he still had to of visited his father and seen the obvious maintenance issues? I can\u2019t help but ponder If our relationship progressed and we were to move in together, is he going to let our home go or leave me to do it? \r\n\r\nWIBTA for wanting to confront the situation? Or, could I possibly offend him by criticizing his fathers home and more so his fathers level of cleanliness - or his level of cleanliness? He\u2019s still grieving his fathers death and they were very close. His obvious denial over the homes condition is what I find most alarming. I feel like bringing this up could really strain an otherwise really good relationship, but I also don\u2019t want to move forward with someone who doesn\u2019t have the same level of motivation to keep things nice. \r\n\r\nI would also point out that I\u2019ve owned two properties in the past and have always worked really hard to maintain everything I have. He\u2019s never owned a home and has always lived in an apartment. Apartment is *cleanISH* for a bachelor pad, but he hasn\u2019t lived there but a year. I\u2019m also afraid when I visit he cleans as much as possible to hide the way he lives when I\u2019m not around. \r\n\r\nIs this red flag material or should I give it time?"}, "1111": {"id": "bc2y9l", "title": "AITA For being in charge of my mother's life support when we were never close?", "body": "Let me start off with I am 23F and have three half siblings (28F, 25M, 20M). We were all raised by our father's and for the most part our mother has been absent in most of our lives. She had been close with my sister for a little bit but burnt that bridge by being selfish and treating my sister and her children poorly. My oldest brother always tried to be close with her, but mom always brushed him off/used him for bail money. Same with my youngest brother. I have never held a conversation with my mother, and have only seen her briefly maybe 6 times my entire life. Mom had a serious history of drug abuse as well.\r\n\r\nWe found out that she is on life support and things look pretty bad. Since she cut contact with the entire family and had no designated POA it was left up to all interested parties to nominate someone to hold control over medical conditions (it's a weird state law). My sister wanted nothing to do with it, my older brother can't handle the stress right now and we all agreed that the youngest is, well, the youngest and we don't want that burden on him. That left me, the one child that she has never even hugged and that knows her the least. I offered up our uncle, but he wanted it to be me as well.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the family wants it to be one of us, as they feel that is most appropriate. I want the best for her medical care, but after speaking with her doctor and nurses she won't be coming out of this/is brain dead.\r\n\r\nI feel like shit to be the one that has to make the decision. I don't even know if she ever loved me, or if she would be okay with me being the one in this position. I would like to be clear that I am only operating with support of the immediate family and won't make a decision if majority rules against something.

I never knew my Father, I've never met him or known anything about him and my Mother doesn't want to talk about him at all. When I was sixteen I found out his name after I was pulled aside by a family member (who was a work friend of his,) and they offered to tell me his side of the story. Basically they had a short relationship after he broke up with his long time GF, they dated for a year and then broke up before I was born. I was also told his name.\r\n\r\nEveryone who knows him (one family member being open about it seems to have opened some kind of flood-gate,) tells me he seems like an alright/good person. From what everyone has said he doesn't appear to be a bad person, simply a man who had a one night stand with someone after a messy breakup which then led to a short relationship and another breakup. He's back with the original woman now and I believe they are married with two young children.\r\n\r\nThough my Mother's reluctance to speak about him makes me hesitant about accepting that judgement. She's never given any indicators that anything bad happened it's just that I don't understand why else it would be such a big secret.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to him, I don't resent him so I don't want it to come across like that, I feel quite apathetic. He's a stranger, I don't know him and whilst I wish him no ill I also don't feel the need to meet him. The most I'd ever want is a medical history if I ever decide to have kids but that's far enough down the line I haven't really thought about that yet.\r\n\r\nThe main thing everyone else has agreed on was that it wasn't his choice not to see me and that, alongside the revelation I have younger siblings who'd like to meet me someday, is why I should give him a chance. My Mother didn't let him see/meet me and I know there was an occasion where he did try to see me. I also know he has a picture of me that he was given by a family member that he's apparently kept and shown to close friends proudly. \r\n\r\nBut I simply don't want to meet him as right now I'm fine, I have closure via now knowing his name and don't feel the urge to speak to someone I don't even know just because they slept with my Mother nineteen years ago. I don't really feel the need to hear his side and the fact he tried to see me doesn't really matter, to me, as at the end of the day he's a stranger.\r\n\r\nBut he does apparently want to meet me and so I'm split on the issue as the general feeling amongst the people I know is that I should give him a chance because he tried to see me and because I have siblings who want to meet me.

My wife and daughter then talked privately about all the specifics and anything that my daughter would have been embarrassed about bringing up in front of me. All in all, my daughter seemed pretty happy about all of it. \r\n\r\nAfter a few days, and after my daughter had told her maternal grandmother and aunts, I asked her if she would mind if I told my mom and sisters, who live in a neighboring country. She said yes, she wanted them to know about her milestone.\r\n\r\nNow, I grew up with two sisters and myself, along with a single mother. They (sisters) told me *everything*, all the time, so I'm pretty aware of all the ins and outs of women's health, even if I haven't experienced any of it myself. My mom, on the other hand, was more reserved and traditional, so she simply never brought it up. But I didn't believe it to be taboo. So I decided to text my mom and sisters and let them know the good news. My mom immediately responded to the group text with \"This is inappropriate.\" One sister replied with \"Oh noo! haha\" and the other didn't reply at all.

He's a wonderful dog and very well-behaved -- doesn't have accidents inside, doesn't bark, etc. When Jim went to basic training for 4-5 months, he had his parents take care of Buck, but when Jim came back, Buck wasn't in good shape (according to Jim). I can say that whenever we've visited Jim's parents (6 hour drive from me), Buck always gets fleas, but even besides that Jim's parents aren't the most reliable. But they don't abuse Buck, from what I've seen, and they love him even if they don't have the resources or total willingness to take the best care of him.\r\n\r\nSo Jim asked if I could take care of Buck starting in October when he leaves. Initially I said yes, because I love Jim and Buck, and I want him to be well treated. My campus doesn't allow pets unless they're for disabilities, but I talked briefly to my roommates and they seemed willing to share a space with Buck, provided he doesn't interrupt their sleep or studying. However, today when I met with my psychiatrist (to see if she could sign off on Buck being an \"emotional support animal\" -- I have depression and anxiety) she told me that she didn't think it was a good idea for me or Buck. I have a ton of responsibilities this semester (classes, applying to grad schools, taking the GRE, working two part-time jobs on campus) and winter is when my mental health does poorest, so my psych thought Buck would give me a lot more stress. And after we discussed it, I agreed with her -- I don't know how Buck will act once Jim is gone, and I can't 100% guarantee he won't be disruptive to my roommates.\r\n\r\nI called Jim to tell him this and let him know that he'd probably have to leave Buck with his parents for ~8-9 months (until I know where I'm going to grad school and can figure out my schedule, pet-friendly housing, etc). He got quiet, and when I asked if everything was ok, he snapped \"yeah, I guess I'll just have to let Buck suffer with my parents.\" He wasn't responsive to me trying to discuss the situation further -- he kept insisting it was fine but clearly sounded upset/mad.

I was never particularly lucky when it came to stuff like dating or relationships, so getting together with him made me super happy. He is good-looking, funny, smart, polite and cute.\r\n\r\nThere is just this... one thing: He\u2018s a sex worker. He does webcam shows, uploads videos of him masturbating and playing with toys on a website (it\u2019s one of those sites where you have to subscribe and pay to gain access) and also occasionally dances at a gay club in my city. He also used to meet up with people who offered  him money and have sex with them, but he doesn\u2019t do that anymore.\r\n\r\nHe confessed all of this to me a month after we met each other. At first I was really uncomfortable with it. I don\u2019t think sex workers are disgusting or anything, but the thought a bunch of other people fucking or jacking off to a guy I\u2018m into didn\u2019t make my happy.\r\nHowever, because the vibes between us were so good, I decided to give him a chance - and I\u2018m glad I did. I didn\u2019t want this stupid thing to stop us from being happy. He\u2018s a great person, lives life relatively responsibly (as far as a 23 y/o can) and, well, I was in love.\r\nThe only thing I requested him to stop doing was meeting up with people for sex. I didn\u2019t pressure him into it, it was just something that crossed the line for me. He understood that and only does webcam shows, the videos and dancing now.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of my friends know about his job and while some of them were weirded out and thought it was kinda funny that I\u2019d date someone like that at first, they all ended up loving him once they had actually met him.

I don\u2018t wanna lie to them about his job (and I don\u2019t want him having to lie about it either) since me and my parents are very honest to each another. I\u2018m also scared that they won\u2019t accept him and maybe even refuse to see him (or me) again. They are both rather prudish and conservative (took them a long time to accept the fact that I\u2018m gay too) so I just can\u2019t see that whole thing going well. I can already hear them say: \u201eThis is disgusting! You\u2019re dating a prostitute! What are the people going to say? He probably has diseases\u201c, etc. \r\nWhenever they ask me when I\u2018m finally going to introduce him, I just tell them that we\u2019re both too busy to match our schedules right now and change the subject. It seems like they\u2019re getting impatient though and I\u2018m not sure if I can put it off much longer.\r\n\r\nI feel really guilty about all of this. I thought I had accepted what my BF does, but the fact that I can\u2019t muster up the courage to introduce him to my parents makes me feel like an asshole.

She told me about it a little, how the family \"picks\" you based on your profile, you go on fertility medicine, and then you get paid like 7k-10k (ish) depending on how many eggs they can get from you. Of course there are possible side effects, it is a surgery after all. \r\n\r\nI brought it up to my fianc\u00e9 who is kind, accepting, and overall perfect for me. He is a very good man. He was able to get through undergrad without any debt, and I'm one semester shy of being done with grad school and have a little over 30k in student loans, which I know isn't bad in the grand scheme of things. My fianc\u00e9 said he doesn't really like the idea of me having little mini-me's running around some state with another family, he worries about the side effects,  and lastly we both agree that no sex for 6 weeks is shitty. I agree with him mostly, I can see how it would be weird having my DNA be someone else's family and i am worried about possible side effects, especially in the event that it somehow gets botched and I end up having trouble conceiving my own children in the future.

The thought of having to start making loan payments when I graduate is making me feel sick and sometimes I just break down and cry.

I shared this with my fianc\u00e9 and he said that it was ridiculous for me to think about doing something this drastic for the possibility of just 1/3 of my loans being paid for, that he would prefer I didn't but he won't stop me if I really am determined to go through with it. \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I attempt to go through with the process?

I thought the best way to go about it would be to make all the sides vegan (half of them already were or were with the use of vegan butter instead anyways) and find a small vegan main to cook that wouldn't interfere with the turkey my mom was doing. We were doing vegan stuffing, dairy-free mashed potatoes, roasted veggies, a vegan gravy, sweet potato casserole, corn fritters, cranberry sauce to all be vegan and for myself, I was making breaded tofu to just throw in the oven once my mom took the finished turkey out to sit then carve. The only non-vegan thinks were going to be the turkey + its gravy and a bit of honey ham. My mom and dad and I and all our guests (so we thought) were happy with this.

He came up 1/2 an hour ago to ask if he could help in any way since he's good at this stuff (he's a chef by trade) but my mom said no because a) our kitchen is far too small for 3 people (2 is pushing it at times) and b) \"Olivia \\[me\\] has got all the sides under control and the turkey's just gone in the oven!\" \r\n\r\nWell after that my brother started inquiring about what I was doing and asked if he could help. I explained how mom assigned me all the sides so I could ensure they were vegan but maybe if we seemed really busy at the end, he could do the mashed potatoes and please just remember to use my milk and butter (tbf we only keep vegan butter in the house at this point because my parents don't think there's enough of a noticeable difference). He got really upset and asked why we were all catering to one person (me)'s dietary restrictions at Christmas. I said it was partially because I was helping to make everything so I get a bit more of a say in how it goes, and besides, there's still turkey. He shot me a \"whatever\" and went to his room.

Anyway, I check my suitcase and get in line for security. \r\n\r\nAfter a couple of minutes waiting in line, I start to feel a poop creeping up on me. No problem. The line isn't terribly long, I can just wait until I get through security and then find a bathroom. As the TSA tends to operate, the line took a bit longer than I was expecting and by the time I got through security I was practically bursting at the seams. \r\n\r\nI walk into the first bathroom and, as most of you can probably guess at this point, the only available stall is an accessibility stall. No problem, I think, what are the chances a handicapped person needs to use the bathroom while I'm in here? Well, as it turns out, pretty high. I'm mid-poop when this dude in a wheelchair rolls into the restroom and tries to open the door to the stall I'm in. Cue my embarrassment. I never knew what it was like to feel like total shit while taking a shit. Word for the wise, it's not fun.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I finish up my business and hope to god that he's not waiting outside the stall so I don't have to face him. Sure enough, he's waiting outside the stall and I have to face him. So I walk out of the stall and try to avoid eye contact at all cost. I can feel the looks of disdain as I, a perfectly able-bodied individual, walk out of an accessibility stall while a handicapped individual who was clearly waiting for that stall goes in.\r\n\r\nI considered posting this to TIFU, but the more I thought about it the more I started doubting that it was a FU. For starters, I would have never taken this stall if another one was available. Sure, I could have waited for another stall to open up, but I had been holding this poop in for quite a while and I had no idea how long that would take. I could have also continued walking towards my gate and tried to find another bathroom, but as I said, I was pretty desperate at this point and didn't know how far the closest bathroom was. There was also no guarantee that the next bathroom would have any available stalls.  \r\n\r\nSo, was I in the wrong for taking the accessibility stall and making the handicapped person wait or was I justified in taking the only available stall?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Had to take a poop.

We have lived on the east coast almost this entire time. Originally, though, we briefly lived with my parents in California because I had just graduated college and needed a place to get on my feet and get a job. My dad was verbally abusive growing up, and was also this way while me and my husband lived there. At that time, we did not pay rent, but we did pay for food. Things came to a head when me and my father got in a fight over something stupid and we decided to fly to the east coast to start our lives there instead. In total, we lived with them for less than 3 months.\r\n\r\nMy dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease just under a year after we left. He does not know who my mother is, who I am, and who the majority of his family/siblings are. He is officially in hospice as of about a month ago, because we suspect that he had a stroke and lost the ability to walk/sit on his own. \r\n\r\nI have been wanting to move to California for some time now, and have admittedly brought it up several times over the last 6 months. Once my father was put into hospice, I began trying to discuss it with my husband more frequently. He initially was very resistant, but as of late agreed that we can try to get back to California after Christmas. I initially agreed to this time line.\r\n\r\nLately, though, we have had some money issues. Our credit card was up to almost 4,000 dollars after 2 emergency room visits even with insurance. Thankfully, we received a stock offering from world and sold those stocks to pay off the credit card and put some money into our vehicle. Husband is saying that we do not have the money to make this trip and that we need to save for a while to afford it. I agree with this in theory. However, now he is stating that instead of breaking our lease to get out there early in 2020, he wants to ride out the lease until May; in May, we would not have to pay to get out of this lease. Our leasing office is asking for $2700 dollars to get out of the lease early. Moving back to California would also require that at least one of us has a job waiting there, essentially, because I have a chronic illness that requires regular medication that absolutely cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I feel like the plan keeps changing and nothing is set in stone. I feel like I don't have a step-by-step of what we are doing and when to guide my \"what do I do next\" thoughts. Most importantly, my dad is in hospice care and will likely not make it until May. I feel like I am losing valuable time with him. AITA for bringing this up with my husband frequently and being frustrated that we have no set plan or goal(s)?

We've been together through thick and thin, and I couldn't imagine a life without him.

We've even browsed engagement rings together to make sure we're on the same page in regards to jewel/size/etc.\r\n\r\nWe're at a point in our lives now that him proposing to me is becoming a very real possibility, and I have a feeling that he's going to do it soon. As in, during our trip to France that's happening in 3 months. It'd be the perfect opportunity because our relationship began when we took a French class together in college and that's what we bonded over - it's the perfect romantic setup, and it definitely seems like the sort of thing he would do.\r\n\r\nObviously, I'm very thrilled about the possibility of this happening. Here's the thing - I'm still in school and I'm pretty insecure about this fact. Because I'd changed majors and failed a few clases, I'm not set to graduate until May of next year even though I was originally supposed to graduate 3 years ago. I consider this a huge source of embarrassment. My boyfriend graduated on time and he's had a stable, well-paying career for some time now, while the only job experience I have is from working retail. He's reassured me many times that it's okay that I haven't finished school yet, that I'm worrying over nothing, and that he's happy to pay more than his share for most of our date nights/other expenses since I have no income. I still feel really bad about this whole setup since it's obviously my fault.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I've really turned things around at uni and should graduate with a decent GPA, so I'm really excited to finally lead a life I can be proud of instead of always hiding. But if my boyfriend were to propose to me in 3 months, I would definitely still say yes, but I'd much, MUCH prefer he do it after I'm out of school, so I can feel like I've, for lack of a better term... earned it?

I wouldn't be able to tell my friends and family that we were engaged without thinking about them judging me and my lack of a career. I wouldn't feel like an equal in our relationship since he contributes more to it financially than I am able to. I hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI realize that this is incredibly shallow and selfish of me. I don't even know whether or not he'll actually propose to me anyway. I just think I'd rather tell him my honest thoughts just in case he does, but then I'd be potentially ruin what would otherwise be an amazing proposal. I am absolutely conflicted. What do you think?

My parents are quite wealthy and bought me a 2 bedrooms apartment when I moved here. Now, I know how to clean, cook and do laundry but, like many people, I really hate doing those things.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, someone from a different university in the same city(20F) contacted me through a mutual friend. She\u2019d heard from that friend that I live alone in a 2 bedrooms apartment and she was curious if she could rent that spare room. Initially I said no because I really enjoyed living alone but then it struck me. I called her back and told her she could have the room rent free if she were to cook for me and do all the cleaning and laundry. I knew her financial situation was not so happy at the time and I was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t refuse. I was right. She studies too but her major is not very demanding and she has a lot of free time, that\u2019s why this arrangement is possible. \r\n\r\nFor the past year the average day looked like this: I wake up, she makes breakfast, then I tell her for dinner I want that and that, then off to our days we go.  She comes home first and by the time I arrive dinner is ready. She does the laundry and cleaning mostly on weekends. I pay the bills entirely and I also provide all the money for buying groceries. One weekend a month, when my parents come visiting, she has to sleep on the couch in the living room because the other bedroom is occupied by my parents. \r\n\r\nYesterday I was hanging out with some friends and this subject was brought up because one of them is interested in setting up a similar thing for himself.

Her parents live out of state, and when they've visited in the past, she's let them stay at her place to be closer, and to save money.

She especially doesn't like the idea of having people who are a little older in anything but an actual bed (especially her parents). It sounds like a respect thing for her, and how she was raised.\r\n\r\nMy point of view is that while I'm very supportive of her parents visiting and want them to come, and want to host them in our home and make arrangements for their comfort, I'm just not comfortable giving up my bed to them. To me my bed is a very private and personal place for only me and my GF.

I even commented \"wow we both ate the same thing, I wonder what made your stomach upset and not mine?\" \r\n\r\nBoyfriend passes out and by 12:30 I'm in the bathroom violently throwing up and to add insult to injury... Got the poops. I'm trying to be quiet, don't want to wake him up, and eventually get back in bed. But I can't sleep. I clearly have food poisoning, and boyfriend finished the Pepto. I try sleeping. I try ignoring my stomach pain. By 1 am I'm back in the bathroom throwing up again. This isn't me just getting queasy, this is now \"I need to make this stop\" territory. \r\n\r\nAfter vomiting for the 4th time tonight, I finally decide to wake up my boyfriend. I gently nudge his arm, and say \"I have food poisoning, or something, because I keep throwing up.\" He is sleepy as hell, and asks if there is anything he can do to help. I tell him, \"yes actually I need Pepto since he finished the bottle\". And he loses his shit. He doesn't want to get up, and when he does he is throwing his clothes around and making a big scene. I asked why is he so mad. And he says \"because you're always sick!\". To which I replied \"I've never once woken you up and asked you to go to the store.\" Which is true. I do get upset stomaches easily. I've literally never even woken him up to simply say \"I don't feel well\". I've handled every upset stomach and painful period on my own. \r\n\r\nBefore he leaves he tells me \"I don't feel well too.\" When he gets back he tosses the bottle of Pepto to me, grabs his pillow and sleeps on the couch. Says nothing to me. Goes right to sleep.\r\n\r\nI still feel like shit. I'm really mad because I didn't choose to get food poisoning. And it's now 2 am. \r\n\r\nWas it an asshole move to make him go to the store when he was tired and apparently also not feeling well? AITA here? I don't think I am, but his attitude makes me think I was supposed to go myself.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Thank you for all the replies! It was mostly nah/esh which helped me realize I'm probably just as cranky as he is. At 4 am I checked on him to make sure he wasn't feeling worse, he immediately asked if I was feeling better and said \"sorry for being a little bitch. I love you and I'm sorry you're not feeling well. That was mean of me earlier\". We hugged and I thanked him for his apology and going to the store, then tucked him back into bed. We good. \r\n\r\nAlso thanks for the suggestions of what could be causing my stomach problems, I'm going to do some research and set up more appointments."}, "1155": {"id": "cj3zvy", "title": "AITA for not wanting my son to be alone with his fathers girlfriend for an extended period of time?", "body": "(Obligatory intro) This is my first reddit post, Not a throwaway, English IS my first and only language, and I'm on mobile so I'll go ahead and apologize for formatting while I'm at it..Go ahead and rip into me if you feel the need, I don't mind. Anywhoo- Details..\r\n\r\nSo I (32F) and my sons father (37M) split up around a year and a half ago. We had been together for 12 years but I found messages between him and a girl he worked with and we inevitably split. We have a child together (11M). He didn't skip a beat and is still with the girl from the texts to this day. I took it hard because even though we were on the rocks and we were both miserable, I really wanted our son to grow up with his parents together, however illogical or stupid that sounds, I prided both of us for keeping it together. Fast forward to present day. The girlfriend (30-31?F) is nice enough. The ex introduced my son and her not too long after the split and they have slowly(not really slowly. I felt like it moved way too fast but this is my first rodeo so I honestly don't know what's normal) been cultivating a relationship. Which is great, the more people to love on my son the better. But  here's the deal.. The new girlfriend was adopted because her and her brother's parents were drug addicts. She has stated that she had to become a mother to her brother at a young age because of their addiction. She has also stated to multiple people multiple times (including myself) that she does not like kids at all and doesn't want any of her own. I'm pretty bothered by that and I want to know if I'm in the wrong.. The ex and I were putting together a contract; if you will. We don't use social services or family court. Neither of us really wants the state involved, but we both wanted something on paper and notarized just for peace of mind. I asked that it be put in the contract that our son isn't to be left alone with a non blood relative for more than 3 hours at a time. This includes my SO. My reasoning is this.. I don't know what psychological issues she might have from her past. My son can be a punk sometimes and who knows what abuse might come out as a result of that..I'm not saying they can't be alone together, I just don't want it to be for extended periods of time. Not yet anyway. I don't know the girl well at all and in my opinion I shouldn't have to trust my ex's judgment. Love is blind and who knows what he would let slide and vice versa. I wouldn't expect him to take my word for it either. But then there is the part of me that recognizes how resentful I am and if maybe I'm overreacting or being overprotective. Even though the ex agreed with little argument, I'm still wondering if I am in the wrong. So alas, here I am on bended knee to the Asshole Lords, begging to know...

At first I thought it had something to do with the room, but I wasn't sure what particular variable would be triggering it. Eventually, I noticed that one of the constant variables in this class is my classmate's perfume, which I always notice as I am sitting down because it smells very strong (and quite nice tbh). On days when I haven't noticed the smell, I've been noticeably less itchy. \r\n\r\nMy hesitation to ask her to stop wearing it mainly stems from two things. 1- I have no conclusive evidence that I am allergic to her perfume, only a strong hunch. 2- She is best friends with one of my best friends.

We all get along pretty well and haven't had any issues so far. 2 of my roommates cook foods from their cultures (for context, one is a Chinese immigrant and the other is a first-generation Indian/Caribbean woman named \"May\") with strong scents that I can't stand tbh but I deal with since it's their home too and I wouldn't like anyone telling me my food smells. A bit about me, I'm a first generation African-American but I cook plain \"American\" food since that's what I enjoy, so my food doesn't give off such strong smells.\r\n\r\nSo I've never considered asking anyone not to cook what they enjoy because I know how personal food is but about 40 minutes ago I stepped out of my room to heat up my dinner and instantly started coughing from all the spices in the air from what May had cooked. I honestly had to crack open the dining/living room windows in 20 degree (Fahrenheit) weather so I could breathe comfortably. And even with that I had to bring out a fan in the kitchen to try to disperse some of the spices in the air. Whatever she cooked is in the fridge so it must have been a lot of spices. Now usually, I would just ignore any food smells I don't enjoy out of respect but in this case WIBTA if I ask her not to cook that specific dish? I just want to be able to breathe in my apartment.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Indian/Caribbean often cooks dishes with strong smells I don't like but I ignore the smells because it's her home too. Tonight she cooks something so strong that when I step out of my room, I start coughing and have to open the windows in 20 degree weather. WIBTA if I asked roommate not to cook this dish again?\r\n\r\nUpdate:  \r\nI sent her a text basically saying I'm so sorry to ask but the spices in her meal were strong enough to trigger me to cough a lot and make my throat hurt. Told her I had to open the windows and use the fan to air out the kitchen and living room. Asked her if she could you please not make that specific dish since none of her others had affected me like that. I reiterated that I was sorry to ask but if it hadn't affected me that much, I wouldn\u2019t be asking. I also blamed it on our our stove fan at the end of the message since we know it doesn't do much at all.  \r\nShe responded well and said it had been bothering her too.

While she says she would never kiss another random girl because she knows it is the same as kissing a guy, she seems to think it\u2019s okay to be kissing her female friends because they are friends. Also, these kisses are mostly just like quick kisses goodbye and not full on making out at this point. \r\n\r\nI on the other hand, feel like any kissing should be considered intimate and should not be shared outside of our relationship.

She got off her call, gave me some more dirty dishes and pans that were out of my sight and went inside.

Now, I don't believe that she and her fella are \"childfree\" in that they actively dislike children or anything, but I do know that they have no plans to have any children themselves and have elected to have no children under 15 attend their wedding.

Generally we rely on three different people: her mother, a family friend of hers or the teenage girl who lives next door.

Occasionally we'd go for drinks and have sex, maybe once every few weeks. Didn't talk much in the interim. We both had crazy schedules and high stress jobs, so it felt mostly like stress relief.

These friends are a group of Grade 12s (Seniors) along with Sophmore and one Junior. They\u2019ve all been a group for a little bit and I recently joined in the summer.\r\n\r\nThese friends are all really awesome and I\u2019m especially good friends with the Junior (let\u2019s call her E), who is the girlfriend of one of the Seniors (let\u2019s call him C).

Me and this group were watching Hereditary and someone asked if the dog died, and asked someone to google it, so I did. They all got \u201cmad at me\u201d for spoiling the movie, and I got upset because they asked me to find out (I found out later they were joking). I have a social disorder and I can\u2019t tell when someone\u2019s being serious or not, as well as anxiety and depression, so I took it seriously.

I later returned after finally talking to E, where she told me I was only noticing the times everyone was saying things about me.

They care far more about Christmas in general and know I'm not overly fussed about it (none of us are religious).\r\n\r\nGrowing up it was all organised/ paid for by my parents, who have now split up and live in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\nMy Sis and BIL are both event organisers and love to host, but also have, in my opinion, an unhealthy desire to control every aspect of Christmas.\r\n\r\nEach year, I receive an email from my Sister that cheerfully dictates exactly how Christmas will run - from waking up to going to bed, what we'll eat to what we'll contribute, in cash terms, towards it. Here's my problem.\r\n\r\nGranted, it costs them a lot of money because they source all the best food and wine from BIL'S events company, cook and prepare it all for us. All we have to do is pay towards it and enjoy Christmas. Easy life for us, right? \r\n\r\nHowever, my gf and I don't ask for this level of effort to go into Christmas. We still pay for a ticket to the coast, bring food, wine and gifts on top of the fee we're charged.

It just feels cold and transactional.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I should talk to my Sister about it.

We had a few bust ups over the summer where he would make plans with me and then go quiet for a day or so, miss the plans and say that he was exhausted from work or ended up out with other friends.

Neither were really happy being married, they pretended , but I could hear them scream and rage throughout the house at night. Admittedly, they're both selfish, and have their own various addictions.\r\n\r\nMore context: My grandfather was a good business man, and through his hard work and investments he provided a large inheritance for his family when he died. After his death,the family split and sued over what they thought was deserved. Grandma and Aunt vs Uncle and Dad. After the settlement,they agreed to never speak again.\r\n\r\nCue my mom and 4 year old me some 10 odd years later. Through a letter she wrote, she reunited my dad with his mother for the sake of her youngest grandchild that she had never met (me).\r\n\r\nThen,Grandma got sick twice and went to the hospital , Aunt and male cousins came up both times to take furniture and other items out of her house that they believed they would inherit one day (contrary to what Grandma's will read out).When I was 18 and Grandma was put in a nursing home,I was charged with caring for her house, and making sure no one removed items. \r\n\r\nFor 5 years I paid bills, fixed things on my own , and kept people out until the estate sale took place.

I had since moved across country(for health reasons),or I would've been there to help.\r\nThe past 2 years my parents have fought over every detail of the sale.This means it sat on the market for 2 years and depreciated, the lawn went overgrown, the roof leaked, the house became dusty and overwhelmed with cobwebs and as such, it sold for way less than wanted and they're now pissed and blaming the other. \r\n\r\nToday: we have until Friday to get the last miscellaneous items off the property, AND we only found out due to someone calling my mom and I because they saw movers .

I have never met her father since he passed before I was born and I have no real connection to him. I didn't even know that was his first name until she told me this.\r\n\r\nI politely told her no; since they're named after two characters who are 'buddy-cops' in the show, the names stay together, and I've already started associating the names with the kittens.

I know OCD is a mental condition and she can not help it. However, it is hard to live with sometimes. Anyway, our apartment is amazing. It is big and new and in a very safe area. Our lease ends in July. I got engaged in Feb. My plan was to move out and move in with my fiancee, and my roommate understood and accepted this. However, finances have made my fiancee decide to wait until the wedding, March 2020, to move in. I told my roommate there was a chance I could stay, and I could tell that excited her.

I decided I probably can't afford this one anymore. I found a studio that is only 100 less than this (for both rent and utilities), but that $100 matters for my low salary. It's the cost of an entire monthly CTA pass. I also have a lot of student loans. The leasing company for this new studio will also  help me find a subletter for when I do get married.

From the start, we spent a lot of time together. Spending a lot of time with her partner is important to her, and I wasn't too fussed either way, so we started spending nearly every night together. At this point in time, we would sleep at the same place (whether it be hers or mine) at least 6 nights a week, and usually spend Saturday day together also (plus any other free days that pop up for both of us)\r\n\r\nThis is a lot for me as it is. I also have to juggle friends, family, uni (which is thankfully over now) and work (I need to save money for a car).\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend wants to spend more time together than what we're doing. In combination with the 6+ nights and 1 day, she also wants me to take days off work to be with her. I'm uncomfortable with this, firstly because I need the money for the car, and also, because I'm already a little overwhelmed with how much time we're spending together as is. I've always felt it's very important in relationships to work around both partners obligations outside their partnership, but as of now it feels like everything else is neglected to a degree because my relationship always comes first. \r\n\r\nI suppose this issue became serious a little while ago. \r\n\r\nTragically, my girlfriend's mother was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells 3 weeks ago. It's very early stages, and there's many avenues for treatment, but of course this is shocking news for the family. She rather dauntingly said that if worse comes to worse, and all treatment fails, she's got 2 years.\r\n\r\nThis naturally upset my girlfriend a lot. She wanted to spend more time with me, clarified very sternly that she needs support from me right now and I'm not doing good enough in providing that support. She remains insistent that I cut back work and such to spend days with her, additionally now because she's going through a rough time.\r\n\r\nAs petty as it sounds, this puts me in an uncomfortable position in the relationship. I'm already slightly overwhelmed with how much we're together, and now it feels as though I have to continue or even enhance this time because my girlfriend says she needs my further support. If I don't take days off work to spend with her, she becomes angry and very upset.\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to commit any more time, or even wanting to cut back the time I spend with my girlfriend? I feel cornered in to an extent, and I'd feel awful cutting back my time with her at this point.

After 3 months of therapy, I started taking amitriptyline for insomnia issues. My issues were rooted in the fact that I couldn't stay asleep and that I would have a hard time sleeping. 2 months into treatment, I've been able to fall asleep within 20 minutes and stay asleep until I needed to wake up. This is the best sleep I've had in a long time.\r\n\r\nNow here's where I might be the asshole. I'm supposed to be taking these pills 2 hours before I fall asleep, I take them at 10pm because quite frankly I'm okay with sleeping at 12am when I wake up at 9am. However, my mom (41F) has been really pissed at me because I'm not going to sleep earlier. She's also been really mad that I stay up taking with my boyfriend (we stay up around usually 11pm-12am, but never later than 12:30am). She only knows that because when I get a call or call someone, she's get a notification on her phone. But, to me, my boyfriend is the only person that I feel comfortable talking to, he knows how my mental health is doing and he supports me. So our phone calls are really important to me.\r\n\r\nBut, according to my mom. I've been breaking my treatment plans and that therapy isn't helping me because she's seen no results and I'm not sticking to the plans. So since I'm not sleeping earlier like she wants me too, she's thinking about stopping therapy and all of my medications. Honestly, it kinda hurts that she thinks that because I thought I was getting better. Especially since she doesn't pay for my therapy sessions, I do.

My in-laws moved from the capital to the  province (1h flight) a long time ago and they had a house in the capital  that was unoccupied. Legally, the house has been transferred many years  ago to my wife but my in-laws still treat it as their house. We take  care of all taxes and costs related to the house (around 10k USD/year).  Half a year ago, my mother-in-law got really sick and my wife asked her  to come over to our place as medical care in the capital is way better  than in the provinces. She got diagnosed with late stage cancer and has  started treatment. My wife is her main caretaker and basically had to  pause her life to take care of her. She had been with us ever since and  probably has made up her mind she will stay here for years to come. My  wife and mother-in-law never had a good relationship and her being in  the house has put a lot of stress on everyone. On top of that my  father-in-law now drops by whenever he wants, sometimes staying up to  two weeks with us and treating it as his house. He has a business in the  province so can't stay with his wife here in the capital as the bills  needs to get paid. The business is not doing so well so we save him  quite a lot of money by taking care of the house upkeep that previously  was paid by him. However having my mother-in-law living in with us has  become unsustainable. So either we move out, leaving them with the house  costs and the care of my mother-in-law (which will be difficult as she  can't join my father-in-law in the province due to unavailability of  medical treatment and he can't join her here because of the business).  Or our preferred solution is to put my mother-in-law in an apartment  nearby with a caretaker (paid by us) and my wife checking on her  regularly on her. We all save money in that way and we can go back to a  healthier relationship with my in-laws.

She can't take regular antibiotics, as they could harm the pregnancy, so she has to put Polydine in her ear twice a day. She has trouble putting in her ear herself, so I do it for her. She has been complaining her ear isn't getting any better, but she also hasn't been consistent with the Polydine. She forgets and doesn't make time for it. I remind her occasionally, but it's not enough. Note - it does seem to improve if she sticks with the twice-a-day plan.  \r\nLast night she asked me to put a reminder on my phone to remind her to use the Polydine twice a day. I said OK, but only if she does as well, since she's the one who needs to be responsible for this. She said OK.  \r\nWhich brings us to this morning - She gets out of bed, and says she has to go to the doctor (regular checkup). I told her right away that we need to put the Polydine in her ear first, and she says she doesn't have time, since she's in a hurry will be closing soon. She then continues to ask me if I put a reminder. I told her no, and she sounded disappointed in me. I asked her if she did, and she said she didn't either. I got angry and told her that I'm glad to remind her and help any way I can, but she has to take responsibility for her own health. This can't be completely on me.  \r\nNow for her side - she says that since she's pregnant she has a lot on her mind, like taking needed vitamins and whatnot. Since she needs me to do it anyway, I should be responsible for it and that I'm only acting out of ego.   \r\nI feel this is childish. As I said, I will help, I will remind her (as I did this morning to no avail), but she can't throw her responsibilities on me.

He has daughter from a pervious marriage (aged 4) divorced nearly 4/5 years. I have met her once, for an hour, we went to the fair. Very sweet girl, we got on well and is spoilt by her father, which is great to see! \r\n\r\nHe started to collect LEGO figures (you know, the one is the mystery bags) and I joined in as it is a fun little hobby and we joke how we make a good team. We have a system of feeling the bags and finding the ones we wanted. It is a good system. His favourite characters are Chip and Dale. He found Dale, and not Chip. He really wanted Chip so I found him Chip when he was feeling down! He was so happy! He stated that he would let daughter play with the others but not allow her to have Chip and Dale. (Back story, daughter was sick a few weeks ago, and I found Elsa for him to give to her \u2013 never got a thank you)\r\n\r\n[This conversation happened over text] He has her for a few hours every Sunday. She noticed that her dad had two toothbrushes and asked 'why?' He stated that is is because one of them is mine. She asked 'So she stays over' he said 'yes'. I asked if she was OK with that, and he replied saying 'It's fine. I'm sending her home with Chip and Dale. Beside she is the only one who doesn't know'.\r\n\r\nI am a little hurt that I found him this LEGO figure that he wanted, but he gave it to his daughter. I feel the whole toothbrush incident and him giving her the figure have something to do with it - so soften the blow or something - I do not have children myself so I am not sure how to feel. A few days ago I wanted Hercules and after a bad week he found me one. In the mean time I got myself a figure (as I wanted Hades) and found Anna for daughter (to go with Elsa), found a Scrooge McDuck (another one he wanted) and a Dale by accident. I told him that I got her one and him some, but he can have them under the request that his daughter cannot have them aside from the Anna. He replied with 'Ok then' followed by 'Thank you'.\r\n\r\nTLDR: AITA for being a little upset over finding him something he wanted, but then giving it away, when he said he was not going too, to his daughter that coincided with her finding out that I am more than just a friend and not allowing my boyfriend to give the ones I find to her?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thank you all.

He's great around kids and I am blessed to have him in my life. Obviously I am happy he found his partner too. They've been very cute together. His partner had a child with his first wife, but that kid died in her teens and that was almost twenty years ago, so he also has no (living) kids, although the ex-wife had a few with a different man that he's close with (it's complicated, but she accepted him when he came out and they're still friends.) Anyway I guess they were talking after they saw that Elton John movie, saying basically how it was so cool that Elton could have kids at basically their age, how he was an inspiration and all that. And now they want kids?! They're looking into adoption agencies and foster care. The thing is, they. Are. Too. Old. Any kid they adopt now will have 90 year old parents when they go off to college.
