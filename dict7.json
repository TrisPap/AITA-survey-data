{"1511": {"id": "9bikcg", "title": "AITA for cuddling/hanging out in my underwear and being generally flirty with a friend who's in a new relationship?", "body": "I'm going to give a lot of background here because I think it's important and the issue isn't as black and white as it may seem.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nI (19F) feel lucky enough to have a best best friend (20M), let's call him Bestie, who I feel 100% comfortable with. We have known each other for a couple years from our previously shared university (he transferred and just started at another school while I go back to the same school in a few days). We used to mostly hang out because we had a lot of shared interests and would do things like cooking and going to the gym together, but we weren't emotionally super close. For most of our friendship he had a long term girlfriend who really hated me (we could never figure out why) and I had a boyfriend who was roommates and close friends with Bestie. Then, last spring, Bestie's girlfriend suddenly broke up with him, and him and I started spending more time together partially because I was helping him with the breakup, partially because we had always wanted to but he had wanted to avoid conflict with his ex. At the same time, my boyfriend/Bestie's roommate and I were in the final countdown of a long and pretty unhealthy relationship. I finally ended things with him at the end of the semester and Bestie really supported me through that. Even though we met at school a couple hours away, Bestie just happens to live 10 minutes from me, and we've essentially been inseparable all summer.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nNow, Bestie and I are both very affectionate people, verbally and physically, and we are both comfortable with each other in a way we aren't with many people. Because of this, we do some things in our relationship that don't seem particularly platonic. We cuddle a lot, just when watching TV or hanging out, and we'll just like touch each other's arms or backs when we're out doing things. It's not uncommon for me to kiss him on the cheek when saying goodbye, etc. Many of my relationships have been like this, with male and female friends. Bestie and I also often get high together and don't feel like wearing pants (bc who wants to wear pants lmao) so before we go to watch a movie or whatever we'll take off our pants and occasionally also shirts before we watch the movie and cuddle. The places to hang out in both of our houses require us to be lying down (his bedroom/my basement with a futon) so it's not like we're going out of our way to cram onto a couch and cuddle.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nWe also joke a lot about how we act like a couple, how everyone thinks we're dating and we don't really care, how we would make a hot couple, etc. We call each other pet names like \"babe\", \"bae\", \"honey\", etc. Bestie used to say when we were both single that he couldn't wait for us to get SOs and make them put up with him and I's complex relationship. I've been dating around this summer and Bestie says he's one of my many boyfriends. We constantly jokingly ask each other \"what are we\" when we do something vaguely couply or domestic. We both understand that this is a complete joke, but even our closest friends have seemed confused about the actual nature of our relationship sometimes.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nBestie and I actually do have the tiniest bit of history, towards the very end of my relationship with my ex (I had decided we were going to break up but wanted to wait two weeks until after final exams were over, it was a very complex situation that I feel secure I was NOT the asshole in even though I felt guilty about it), we started flirting a lot. I never would have cheated, but I found myself imagining a relationship with Bestie after things had ended with my ex. We talked about our feelings after me and my ex broke up and ended up hooking up a week or two later. That was the first and only time, however, because we both really didn't enjoy it and realized that we are completely incompatible sexually/romantically. We both view this experience as having strengthened our relationship as friends because there is absolutely zero sexual tension between us, because we both know we're not into it.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nAnyway, about halfway through the summer Bestie started seeing a girl who he really really liked. I really like her too, and they casually dated for a month or so before making things official about two weeks ago. I am still single and dating casually, very much by choice. I'm starting to feel as though it might be shitty for me to keep engaging in the same behavior with Bestie as we did all summer when we were both single. His girlfriend knows we're very close and she's supportive of us and wouldn't ask him to change his behavior with a friend for her, but I don't think he's had an explicit conversation with her about what we're doing (cuddling, hanging out pantsless) to clear it with her. She knows we'll lie in the same bed together because he snapchats her while we're together, but she can't see that we're not wearing pants and I'm pretty sure he's never told her. I have felt like it wasn't my place to tell him what to share in his relaationship, but I'm starting to feel like this might be inappropriate. I don't really want to change my behavior with Bestie because it's been this way for several months and wasn't sexual before he was in a relationship, but I really don't want to make this girl uncomfortable or in any way negatively affect their relationship. AITA for not pushing Bestie to talk to his girlfriend about this? AITA for engaging in this behavior in the first place?\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nA couple other brief points:\r\n\r\nBehavior is initiated pretty equally, or, recently, more by Bestie (since I've been having these doubts). He'll take off his pants first, he'll reach over to cuddle first, etc.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nBestie and I are also both bisexual, which I think is important because we view our relationship with each other the same way we would view a close friendship with someone of the same gender. Since everyone is a potential sexual option, it doesn't matter to us that we're opposite genders; however, it might matter to Bestie's gf (who's straight) or from another outside perspective.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEDIT: Bestie told girlfriend on his own about him and I hooking up, close to around the time they started dating. Most of the verbal affection between me and Bestie she has witnessed and has expressed no issue with. The only thing she's in the dark about is the cuddling/lack of clothes.

When I first moved in, I had to travel very far from where I lived with no job set up and a couple hundred in savings. I ended up not being able to find gainful employment, working odd jobs and bad hours for some time. For a while I had so little money I ate either rice and beans for a few days or did not eat at all. I did not ask her directly for food, but I did complain about the lack of it I had been eating. She fed me a handful of times, always choosing to buy me take out from a pricey restaurant, when I would have accepted any meal from anywhere. I figured she should have bought food from the grocery store and made it or have me make it because it would have been cheaper, but I kept my mouth closed because beggars can't be choosers, right? Eventually I found good, steady work, but not before I had to have her front me 2 months worth of rent, to pay my half. Last month, I finished paying her back, so we are even, but now our situation has changed a little.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nShe has started going to school, and is going full time while also trying to working part time. I say trying, because despite setting an alarm for 6 or 7 every morning to go to work before school, she turns off the alarm and goes to sleep until about 9am when she will then get up and get ready for school and skip work altogether (She is not in danger or losing her job, her bosses know the situation and are OK with her not showing up). Because of this lack of work, she is now struggling financially and often cannot afford to feed herself a healthy and stable diet, since she spends what little money she has on juul pods (and often a new Juul, too, because she loses them so frequently), cigarettes and gas for school and work. She also is planning on asking me to pay her half of the rent this month, meaning she would later owe me money (We've already discussed this and I agreed it makes sense, because we do HAVE to pay rent)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThe problem I have been having is that she often eats the food I buy (she always asks first but I have a hard time saying no) and I will often buy food for a meal, cook it for myself intending it to be my meal for a few days so I can save money, but she will eat that, too. My problem is, I am making myself a pot roast tonight and I spent quite a bit of money on the materials (chuck roast is PRICEY) and I was hoping to be able to eat the whole thing over a few days. I preemptively asked her to not eat any of it, because its a nice treat for myself and it cost some money. She got a little upset and said its fair, but wishes I would share with her because she would share with me if I were in that situation. AITA for standing my ground and not sharing?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSorry for the very long post. Happy to answer any questions to clarify any parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: talked to her about why she is upset I didnt want to share this meal. She said it's because I make a really great pot roast. I told her I wanted to make it for myself as a treat after having recently gotten out of the hospital and to celebrate getting better. She said she understood and is happy to let me have it. She also said she feels bad she hasn't cooked anything for a few months and said she will strive to cook food for us at least once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: unless you're going to read all the comments, dont bother telling me to talk it out.

Some people were standing up. This lady gets on the train and is standing near me. She is a bit older, maybe in her 50s, and looks like she could use the seat more than me so I offer it to her.\r\n\r\nSo I've given her my seat now I have to stand up. There's not much space so I decide to move to  a different part of the carriage. I don't know why but I kinda expected my boyfriend would get up and come with me. I didnt see it as a big deal. But as I moved down I noticed he wasn't coming with me. Now let me say that I would not care at all if he came or not; he could keep his seat if he wanted and I wouldn't mind standing elsewhere. But I didn't realise he didn't want to get up. I made eye contact with him and gestured for him to come with me to stand somewhere else. He seemed hesitant but I didn't take much note of this and thought he just wasn't understanding my gestures (the train was very quiet so I didn't want to talk outloud).\r\n\r\nSo then he got up and we found another place to stand. Then he said, \"Why did you do that?\"\r\n\r\nI said \"What?\"\r\n\r\nHe complained about my giving up my seat and then making him move as well. He said I shouldn't have given the lady my seat and should have just remained seated. He was annoyed that I asked him to get up and thus made him lose his seat.\r\n\r\nWell again I just didn't see it this way. I give people my seat all the time as I'm young and fit, and feel guilty to make older people stand up. And I didn't see it as a big deal to stand up on the train, but apparently it was a big deal to him. Eventually he said \"It's ok don't worry, just don't do it again.\" Well I didn't realise he felt like this and again I wouldn't have cared if he stayed seated and I went elsewhere. But I didn't realise that is what he wanted at the time. AITA?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nedit- i Kinda felt bad the rest of the train trip, and felt like I should have just stayed seated like he said , which is why I'm asking now as I feel guilty about  the situation and am not sure.."}, "1514": {"id": "a12n18", "title": "AITA For Wanting to Spend Time With My Girlfriend?", "body": "This happened last week and has caused some bumps with me and my girlfriends relationship. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend (F16) lives in my home state, however, I (M16) live all the way across the country because I am going to school.

My schedule is different every week but my hours are usually always 2 or 3 morning shifts (6am-3pm) and two overnight shifts (11pm-10am). Occasionally I might work a different shift but basically I work anywhere from 8 to 11 hours straight and at my job I do not get breaks. My boyfriend goes to school (8am-10am) and work (5pm-830pm).

I usually just didn't mind because it was some good alone time to clean up and sleep.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nOkay, SO, yesterday I started work at 12am and got off at 6am, both bf and daughter came home and went right to sleep.

I remind him that he is off tomorrow and that when I'm home daughter usually sleeps in till 9 or even 11 if she goes to bed late. He proceeds to tell me that he's not her babysitter or her stepfather. This might just be me but it makes me pretty upset. I tell him I dont know why he got with someone who has a kid if he can't accept said kid as his own and that maybe we should break up because while his main focus is school mine is family. Mind you, he says he wants a child of his own in a few years. He comes home and tells me he is just upset because I was upset earlier (I got mad because I am the only one who cleans) and when I try to say something he screans \"I DONT GIVE A FUCK\" and leaves, slamming the door and breaking it (wont stay closed unless deadbolt is locked).

Anyways, I was driving her back to her house and cutting through some back roads and we see some people walking up the street.  I live in the Northeast and it's very cold outside right now.  She sees them and gets this huge smile on her face and tells me to \"watch this.\"  She starts rolling her window down and starts opening up her water bottle.  At this point I'm pretty sure she's going to douse them with water in frigid temperatures.  I tell her not to do it, but as we drive by them she flings the water out of her water bottle all over them and laughs and gives me the biggest shit eating grin.\r\n\r\nI was fucking pissed, because I'm pretty sure what she just did could be considered assault and if they got my liscense plate I could be liable.  So I pulled over about 100 yards past her victims (they could still see us) and told her to get the fuck out of my car.  She looked at me shocked like she did nothing wrong and refused.  I reached across and opened the car door, and then unbuckled her seatbelt and told her to get the fuck out of my car again.  Again she wouldn't and told me to just drive her home.  So I pushed her out of the car, drove forward a little bit so she couldn't scramble back in, and tossed her purse out a little further up.  And then I drove off and left her on the side of the road.\r\n\r\nObviously she blew up my phone calling me an asshole, and its needless to say that whatever this relationship was it's over at this point.  I dont think I was out of line, but she did only have a sweatshirt which is not the best in freezing weather.  She claimed she had to run away because the people she flung water at started coming at her.  And I know she's broke ass, so it's not like she could call an Uber or Lyft, she would have had to get a friend or family give her a ride if she could find someone (she had her phone), otherwise it was probably a 6-7 mile walk home.\r\n\r\nI dont feel bad for kicking her out of my car, what has me doubting myself is the conditions I left her in (potentially violent situation, no heavy winter clothing, and broke).  AITA?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT2, the Captain Hindsight edit:  So I'm going to make a couple of clarifications based on some of the comments I've seen pop up, and then I'll give you what I would do in hindsight.\r\n\r\n1.  I said the weather was below freezing, I should have been specific.  I'm not talking -6\u00b0F, it was just below freezing around 30\u00b0F.\r\n2. I didn't kick her out with a t-shirt and shorts on.  She was wearing jeans, a couple of layers of clothing, and a hoodie.  She wasn't wearing a heavy winter jacket, but I didn't kick her out naked and afraid.\r\n3. Prior to her throwing the water out of the window, the people walking on the street were walking in the opposite direction I was driving.  When I was driving away after kicking her out, it looked like they were still walking in the same direction in my rear view.  I even looked before I went around a bend and lost line of sight on her and it still looked like they were walking in the opposite direction (and she wouldn't need to walk that way, she would be walking the same way I was driving).  I mentioned that she claimed they started coming after her, which they very well may have after I left, but I didn't see that.  If it looked like violence would have been brought down upon her, I would have picked her back up.  I'm not a monster.  Also, to those of you saying she could have been murdered or kidnapped, lets be real.\r\n4. Again, I should have clarified this before but I live in a very safe and populated residential area.  It was 6-7 miles back to her house, but only about 1-1.5 miles to a main road with public businesses and she knows the area very well.  Like I said before, she had jeans, layered tops, and a hoodie.  She was not going to freeze to death.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I appreciate everyone's input and it seems like most of the comments seem to be a mix of ESH and NTA.  Some of them definitely raised some good points, what I did was definitely dumb because it could have been potentially criminal (although I'm not sure about what the laws are in my state about removing someone from your vehicle).  And I agree with what a lot of people said about dropping her off at some kind of business somewhere else.  If I could do it again, I'd probably bring her to a gas station and ask her to go get me a drink from inside while I pump gas, and then ditch her there.  That being said, like I clarified in this edit, she wasn't going to die from exposure.  I do disagree with the people saying that I should have driven back to the people and made her apologize.  For one, I'm not her father.  I'm not going to make her apologize like an eight year old that took another child's toy.

Me (M17) and her (F17) have known each other since fifth grade, and had been great friends throughout school. We were in the same friend groups. Then, we decided to get together. We shared all of our firsts, and everything was going absolutely perfectly.\r\n\r\nShe has a disorder that doesn\u2019t allow her to drive, so I would be her mode of transport. I was perfectly fine with it, and it was fun, although the rides were needed to a point where my family was mad at me for taking her so often.\r\n\r\nFor a weekend in November, we went on an extracurricular trip to this hotel where you were paired into groups and debated and other little fun things. During these two days, a boy, who was also 17 and from Memphis, gave her his snapchat. She took it, and kept snapping him back and forth, and kept insisting that he was just a friend and I had nothing to worry about. \r\n\r\nWell even after the debate thing was over, she kept snapping him. I asked her if she could stop cause it seemed as if he kept her attention more than I had. She promised she did. She \u201cdeleted snapchat\u201d, and said bye to him.\r\n\r\nThen, the next few days, on our days out we were just as happy as we had been, and I was driving her to friends houses and work. Everything seemed great, but I noticed that she was still snapping him, and I asked her about it and she denied, and then I just told her I knew she that she still was.\r\n\r\nShe broke down in tears and begged me not to leave her in my confrontation. I felt broken, and I still loved her for sure, and I thought her begging showed that she did too.\r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t the same after that. She and I still went on car rides, but I didn\u2019t feel the same. I just felt sluggish for some reason. She was peppy and energetic, and was really let down by all this. I started spiraling into a sadness that just seemed to never end, but honestly she would cheer me up so much, just because I felt her love.\r\n\r\nOne day, she really wanted to go to her friends Christmas party, but I had a lab after school that day, and I really didn\u2019t want to drive to the party. Looking back, I regret this so much, it really would have made her so happy, and I can\u2019t help kicking myself over it.\r\n\r\nThen, a few days afterward, she and I were sitting in my car five minutes before class, and she told me that we needed to take a break in our relationship. I broke down in tears so hard, I still can\u2019t believe how emotional I was. It was bad. She told me that she wanted to become more independent and non-reliant on me, which honestly, looking back I respect a lot.\r\n\r\nShe still wanted to be friends, and it was hard for me to do. I still wanted to be with her.\r\n\r\nA day later, she texted me and told me that she loved me, not as a friend, but as we were. I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I met her, and hugged her, and she talked about how much she missed everything. I felt amazing. However, at the end of the day when I met up with her, she coldly told me to go away and that she just needed space. God was I confused. I literally don\u2019t understand how that shift could have happened in less than three hours.\r\n\r\nI messaged some of her friends who were also my friends about her, and just what was going on. I went WAAAAYYY too emotional and kept saying stuff like \u201cbut I want her to know I\u2019m still in love\u201d and stuff, and they told me they weren\u2019t sure what was happening either. She caught wind of this, and was blasting me through texts, and was furious that I wasn\u2019t leaving her space, which in the present, I understand.\r\n\r\nI gave her some space, and I started acting as her friend again. Sending her memes and stuff and just having fun with texting. She then called me and was crying and telling me that her parents found out she was buying weed off someone because all of her incoming texts were sent to her parent\u2019s phone as well. And then she mentioned that the guy who she was snapping was bringing her a fake ID, and they knew about that too. Then she casually mentioned that they were going on a date.\r\n\r\nI was so disappointed. I don\u2019t know why. I guess I was still into her, but it was only a week since she took a break. I felt like she backed against her word of being independent. I felt betrayed. I didn\u2019t have any motivation to help myself anymore, and I was back on the rollercoaster of emotion I was during the week. \r\n\r\nThe next day was the last day of school until our break, and I wanted to talk to her face to face about this. I told her that he destroyed our relationship, and I asked her how she thought that was okay to do to me, as she said I was her best friend. The last thing I said was \u201cyou can choose either me as your best friend or him as your boyfriend, you can\u2019t have both\u201d. She stormed out and told me not to talk to her. \r\n\r\nShe was throwing nasty texts at me after that, and things just turned toxic. She said that I should feel happy for her, and that this week has been the worst in her life, because her parents acting crazy.\r\n\r\nI felt like she totally didn\u2019t care about my emotions at all. She didn\u2019t realize how bad she was confusing me and hurting me I guess. I don\u2019t know. She\u2019d been talking bad about me the whole week apparently, saying that I was \u201cnever going to move on\u201d, telling that to so many people.\r\n\r\nWas making her choose an asshole move?\r\n\r\nEverything is so toxic with her now, and I think our relationship is totally ruined.

Yeah she smokes weed and yeah she\u2019s a social person but she\u2019s genuinely my best friend and the sweetest person who has ever graced this Earth. \r\n\r\nAnyways, my brother carried on with these aggressive and mean comments the entire night so I went up to him and said to him \u201cif you talk to her like that one more time I will literally beat the shit out of you\u201d and that shut him up for a little. \r\n\r\nOnce the parents were doing their separate thing after dinner, my brother started talking shit again.

Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\r\n\r\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000\u20ac to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\r\n\r\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3\u20ac for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20\u20ac left for the last two weeks of the month).\r\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\r\n\r\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000\u20ac raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\r\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\r\n\r\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000\u20ac is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\r\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\r\n\r\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \r\n\r\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\r\n\r\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\r\nhaven't heard from her since.\r\n\r\nWas me even asking too much?\r\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\r\nI seriously don't know, \r\nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\r\n\r\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \r\nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.\r\n\r\n"}, "1521": {"id": "adkcy6", "title": "AITA For calling my wife a leech?", "body": "I (27F) have been working for our entire relationship.

(We dated for roughly 2 years)\r\n\r\nDani and I would go get food, chat about what's been going on, new people we were seeing, etc. We'd probably meet up once a week, just to chat and joke.\r\n\r\nDani would talk about new guys she was seeing, I'd help her (genuinely, I want her to be happy) by giving some advice about how to pursue them, or once in a while say maybe this guy wasn't a good idea for her. \r\n\r\nOn this particular day, I really wanted to talk about a new girl I was super into (call her Jen). Jen and I are co-workers, so Dani kinda had an idea of who she was. \r\n\r\nMeal starts off fine, Dani is talking about a new guy she's with, I'm cracking a couple jokes, all is normal. Soon, I start to shift the conversation towards me and Jen, and Dani has an immediate tone shift. She gets a little cold, starts being rude and making some pretty harsh comments. \r\n\r\nI don't notice this right away (I'm 20m and pretty ignorant tbh) so I continue talking. Soon Dani calls Jen a bitch, and starts saying some REALLY off things about her, who she really doesn't know. Saying things like \"she's just a bitch\" \"she won't like you\" \"she's gross\" yada yada. At this point, I'm a little more than offended, so I tell Dani I'll drive her home, because I'm done here and I really don't wanna talk to her anymore.\r\n\r\nWe take her food to-go and start driving to her house. On the way I tell her I thought it was pretty shitty of her to just beat up on this new girl who I really like, and Dani goes off about \"am I not allowed to have an opinion? Can I not say what I feel?\" \r\n\r\nSomething about how she says this really heats me up, and I kinda lose my cool here if I'm honest. I shout at her saying she can have an opinion, but she's can can also try not being a piece of garbage when she tells it to me. \r\n\r\nNow I'm not exactly a shouting kind of guy.

The text conversation was pretty rough if I'm honest, both sides were pretty angry and it only made me more pissed.\r\n\r\nAs I get back to her house, shes out front, and I'm really not feeling talking to her. So as I pull up, I roll down my window and just chuck the keys in her direction. (I don't hit her with them, they land somewhere near her at her feet) and immediately start backing out. I can see she's giving me the finger as I leave and hear \"enjoy the soup asshole.\" So I chuck the soup out the window after as I drive off. \r\n\r\nNow I know I probably overreacted, but I seriously feel I was justified.

I had a couple friends over (a rarity for me) and was stressing out getting shit sorted for bed and dessert and whatnot. My sister, Petunia was wearing a top which was low-cut and walked in the kitchen as I was leaving and I said to her \u201cI think you\u2019re missing a couple buttons\u201d in what I didn\u2019t think was a serious tone. She didn\u2019t say anything else  and went to her room. A while passes and I\u2019m sitting down and check my phone and it\u2019s a message from her boyfriend (they\u2019re in the same room) and it said \u201c 5meirl7meirl, I want to have a word with you on how you spoke with Petunia\u201d. I didn\u2019t take it too seriously because he\u2019s pretty easy-going and I didn\u2019t connect his request to my comment. I go in there (friends watching infinity war), I go in and she basically says that what I said was sexist and that those sort of comments are the kind of comments that are the reason women are preyed upon. Petunia bf - someone who I really respect backed her up and I got really annoyed. I replied saying \u201cThat is not sexist, I would have said that to a guy or a girl\u201d they basically then regurgitated what they previously said. I left her room annoyed and just went back to watch the movie. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day/Today, I don\u2019t really talk to Petunia and her bf until Petunia says \u201cIs there beef between us?\u201d in a joking tone. I just replied \u201cno\u201d. If she was willing to forget, so was I. \r\n\r\nLater that day, my other sister, Julia is talking to Petunia about it. \r\n\r\nQuick descr. of Julia: Julia is an arts student who  is part of the lgbt community and once likened Thomas Edison \u201c a man who stole other people\u2019s ideas and took credit for it\u201d to \u201cbasically all white men\u201d. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that bad in reality but, she has got - what I feel - some wacky ideas. \r\n\r\nAnyway, they bring up the topic again and I restate my point that if you make a comment that you would to a person of any sex, it\u2019s not sexist. They start bringing up how Julia was made fun of because of her breasts and how men in public wolf whistle and from that, they say that \u201cif someone makes a comment about a woman and she finds it offensive, then it\u2019s sexist. I reply and say \u201cif someone called me human, and I found that offensive, would that be sexist?\u201d (Stupid example, I know). So Julia starts crying and I just leave because 1. I\u2019m not good with helping crying people (makes me uncomfortable) and 2. I believe that I\u2019m in the right and don\u2019t want to concede. As the youngest only boy out of 4 kids, I often don\u2019t win. I call my parents and they back me up, saying they find it a bit weird, but  they sympathisewith Julia (their favourite, I\u2019m not mad). I, for the rest of the night refuse to talk to them, basically giving them the silent treatment and I decide to listen to music and start to clean up the house. I do this for about  half an hour and then Petunia starts yelling at me to start talking to her and she wants to know why I\u2019m not talking to her.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Petunia has recently been diagnosed with some really bad disabling diseases that basically make her diet restricted and means she can\u2019t do much in the way of exercise. \r\n\r\nI still refuse to talk to her and she breaks down crying, begging me to talk to her. I refuse because I always feel that in situations like this, she\u2019s very emotionally manipulative and I don\u2019t want her to \u201cwin\u201d again. So I don\u2019t reply. After she makes her food, she asks if I wanted her to do the dishes as she just used the pans to cook her dinner. I say \u201cno, I\u2019ll do it\u201d. She continues crying and throws out her dinner in the bin. I finish the dishes and then call my dad, working late at work. He says to wait a bit and then to say to Petunia: \u201clet\u2019s forget about it\u201d. I resist but then I concede his point.

It's a long story, so here i go!\r\n\r\nBackground : I (20M) am living with four other room-mates at my old mother's house. Since she wasn't able to sell it, she rented it to me and my friends (one guy and two girls). Note that we did not sign a lease, since it was a friendly agreement. At first, the rent was a bit expensive for only four people, so one of the girl brought her friend (26F) in September. It wasn't sure how many months she was supposed to stay, but we were pretty happy about it. When I met her, I immediately knew that she was the anxious kind of person, and I felt for her. But I didn't know what was to come.\r\n\r\n>Her presence alone changed the dynamic in the house. She decided to buy a cat (to help reduce her anxiety), even thought the first floor was supposed to be cat-less because there is one girl that is allergic. I had cats that stayed in the basement and they had fights with the new cat, which she indirectly blamed me for. Every time I encountered her in the house, I tried to have a friendly chat with her, but I felt some weird tension. When I asked her for simple services, such as a little bit of olive oil, it always seemed to disturb her and she often declined with what seemed a lack of empathy. Often, I put that on the account of her anxiety disorder (she eventually told me she had one) and let it go. But then, she also started complaining about the housework in a backdoor way. For example, she left a list on the fridge on the 'steps not to forget when cleaning the kitchen' and notes such as \u00abParasites are at our door!\u00bb. Me and the other guy knew that it concerned us, we just didn't understand why she didn't told us about her discontent first. We did not felt good about it. Also, whenever she wrote in our house group chat, it was only to complain and express her discomfort about something.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I had my load of anxiety living with her and I considered many times having a talk about the situation, to explain how and why we feel uneasy, and also to understand why she acted that way. I never did, since I knew she would not be at ease and would start to either blame herself of reject the blame. Months passed and it was going fine, until she started worrying about what was going to happen in July 2019 (we were in January, btw). Since I did not want to live with her another year (and since the other girls were moving out of town next summer), I told her she'd have to look for another place to stay in July. Then, one week ago, she told me she had found a new place to stay and that she would leave at the end of the month. I was kind of shocked. I asked her if she would at least pay her rent for February, which resulted in a categorical refusal. I told her that usually, when leaving a housing, you need to notify one month in advance, therefore that she had to pay for next month also. Big anxious no. I asked again. Still refusing, saying that she won't pay for two rents at once, that she already signed the lease at the other place and that anyway, she hadn't signed any lease with us.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThat's when I lost it. I got really pissed off, I raised my voice and started ineffectively asking again and again. I was boiling. She repeated that there was no lease. I shouted \u00abWell if there is no lease, we could just kick you anytime we want and you'd have no right to stay here!\u00bb \\[Still refusing\\] \u00abDon't expect to stay the whole month here\u00bb. I then left the house for the rest of the day. When I came back, she was gone. She took all her things and left.\r\n\r\nI had talked about this with my friend and he agreed with me that she was a toxic person. But the girls were on her side, even thought we never talked about it. I know it wasn't right to burst in anger and shout at her, but I feel that it was justified. Am I the asshole? Should I have acted differently?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEdit TL;DR : A new anxious room-mate changes our friend's household dynamic, then finds another place to stay and won't pay another month of rent.

The old man (and I admit I laughed at this a little inside) said, \"I never called her a gorilla, I called her a bitch!\" I said again that it was the woman called me a gorilla.\r\n\r\nThe woman threatens to call the police and I said, \"Please do!\" Because I feel like how can you argue that a person is a car? And parking spots are for cars? Also, I didn't hit her?\r\n\r\nAITA for not driving on and just giving her the parking spot? Is that by default an A-hole move? Because she was so angry it makes me question it. Is there an unspoken code for drivers that if someone is standing in a parking spot, just move on? I argued back because she yelled first. I've been conflicted about this since it happened. When I saw he was older, I felt kinda bad. I just want to add that I feel like if she had said to me civilly, instead of coming at me yelling, \"My dad is an older dude, is it okay if we take this spot\" I would have moved. \r\n\r\nI did look up afterwards to see if it's legal in my town for people to hold parking spots. And in a nutshell, it's not, but also don't hit people with cars. Which I didn't.\r\n\r\nEdit: Thanks, everyone. Looks like I am NTA for taking/keeping the spot, ESH for yelling.\r\n\r\n"}, "1528": {"id": "aiwb5l", "title": "AITA and creating unnecessary problems at work?", "body": "I (33 M) have been dealing with ongoing issues with a colleague who I will refer to as G (40 F) at work. I am having trouble letting go of the situation and don't feel like I am in the wrong, but would like some validation in my opinion or to hear differing thoughts regarding the situation. \r\n\r\nJust some background, this colleague and myself have been with the company for around 9 years and have worked together for 4 of those years. We ate lunch together daily, often times separately from people within our department and regularly had personal conversations regarding our families. I felt it was a very good relationship, which is likely why I am having issues with what the situation has degraded too.\r\n\r\nThe company I work for is going through a major expansion and my entire department as well as others has been moved multiple times. One of the more recent moves, paired myself and G in a rather small cubicle. Everyone in the department was in a similar situation, some had more space, some had less, but for the most part was about equal. G was vocally upset regarding the closeness of our seating situation and informed myself, others in the department and our direct report of her unhappiness. I don't know if G ever asked to officially move, but there really wasn't any space to move to even if she had made a request. I was a little hurt that she would be that upset to share a cubicle with me, but I saw her point of view as it was close proximity and thought if was a good cubemate she may be more comfortable. As time went on the situation escalated as she became more vocal and began telling individuals in other departments of her discomfort, many of whom I did not know. I felt as if these people were looking at me like I was behaving inappropriately towards G. It was very uncomfortably for me, but I didn't want to ask someone that was genuinely uncomfortable to not voice their discomfort. I informed G that her saying this bothered me and asked if I could do anything better or different that might alleviate her discomfort. She told me there wasn't anything I could do and that it was just a proximity issue and that it wasn't personal. While I was still uncomfortable, I trusted her and believed she was not being malicious or attempting to make me look bad and opted to let it go and not make a big deal about the situation.\r\n\r\nAfter approximately 8 months of us sharing a cubicle, it was time for my department to move again. The week before we were scheduled to move, G asked if I wanted to go out for lunch, I had made previous lunch plans and couldn't go, which is what I informed her. I then saw her go and ask others in the department about going out for lunch, but they all had other plans as well. I felt bad because she and I usually got lunch together and it looked like she was going to have to eat alone, so I recommended G check and see if a friend of hers whom we regularly met for lunch was available, G responding by stating that was a weird and creepy thing to say. I often reminded her to text this friend when we went to lunch and I didn't view my recommendation as any different than that reminder. I had never been referred to as weird and creepy and didn't know what to do, so I just went to my lunch obligation without responding. The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me, two days after she referred to me as weird and creepy, I brought it up again, thinking she would talk about how it was a crazy day and that I caught her at a bad time, or that it was a miscommunication, something along those lines. Instead, she loudly and angrily referred to me as weird and creepy again, I tried to explain that I just felt bad and didn't want her to feel excluded, but she just kept loudly stating that it was weird and creepy, over and over. G was saying this loud enough that another colleague walked over to mediate and try to calm the situation, but he was unable to do so and I felt so humiliated, that I just stopped talking, wondering what I did wrong and hoping no one else would hear what she was saying. No one wants to be thought of as weird and creepy and to be told that by someone at work whom you trust was truly awful. We still had a few more days of sitting in the shared cubicle, I didn't understand why she spoke to me that way and wanted to talk about it, but the way she went off on me was so embarrassing, that I didn't know how to act, so I just put on headphones and focused on work. Over the course of the next few days, G acted like nothing had happened and I couldn't believe it. How could you say something like that, never talk about it and pretend like nothing had happened? I just wanted her to acknowledge that it was wrong or show some sign of caring that she hurt me, but she never did and the last day we sat next to each other was not a good one. I went to work and moved all of my belongings out of our shared cubicle early, G later mentioned to me how she had to wait for facilities to help her move, but I feel like she made this comment expecting me to offer to help. I did not offer, but rather told her that sitting next to her was not a good experience for me, packed up the remainder of my things and went to my new work area.\r\n \r\nThe new area we moved to is much larger, with everyone having their own space. About a month after moving, I noticed G spending a lot of time at the cubicle of another colleague, whom she does not share work responsibilities with. I likely would not have noticed, but this particular colleague sits adjacent to me, so I can't help but see when she goes to his cubicle. On multiple occasions, I have seen her sitting on his desk, much closer than what we sat at our cubicle, which had been a major issue for her. I overheard a conversation, where the same colleague asked her about lunch plans, specifically where she went to lunch and he was not told he was creepy or weird like I was previously. I can't help but view this as highly personal now. I feel like I was spoken about in a derogatory manner to colleagues and that I was called hurtful names, not because of anything I did, but because she had an issue with me the whole time and I was just too foolish to notice. I am so disappointed with myself for just sitting there while she spoke in what I now feel was a derogatory manner about me. I am so angry that I didn't yell back when she called me hurtful names, I wish I had so badly and I don't know how to let it go.\r\n\r\nI hoped time would heal all wounds, but it didn't, every time she goes to the other colleagues cubicle, it feels like an insult to me. I went to our direct report and informed her (40 F) of what occurred. She spoke to G regarding the issue and scheduled a meeting, at my request, to address the situation. The meeting went very poorly, G did not take it seriously, informed me I was only taking issue with her due to her gender and repeatedly threatened me with going to HR. I do not handle confrontations well and could have handled it better. Some of the meeting going poorly is most definitely my fault, but I strongly believe the fault is mostly hers. At the conclusion of the meeting, my direct report sat separately with each of us. My boss informed me that those threats were inappropriate and that nothing would come of it, that she believed me and other people had come forward with work related issues regarding G. My direct report scheduled another meeting two weeks later, but before the second meeting could occur, G suffered a tragic lose in her family and went on bereavement for 2 weeks. I have lost people in my life and felt horrified that I could in anyway worsen a already awful situation. My direct report informed me, that the second meeting would be canceled and that another one would be scheduled approximately 5 weeks after G returns from bereavement. I told my direct report that a time frame wasn't necessary, to use her judgement and schedule a meeting when she felt G was up to it. That was approximately 3 months ago and nothing has been scheduled or spoken about since then. I still feel the same as I did previously, I just want G to explain why she felt it was necessary to act like that and acknowledge that what she said was hurtful and that she should have addressed the situation differently. I am angry all the time at work and everyday I think about confronting her, creating a scene, forcing her to address it. But another part of me remembers how we used to stop for coffee and that I genuinely did enjoy her company. I think about how G just suffered a lose and I want to give her a hug and offer support, but I believe with all my heart that she thinks I'm creepy and weird. And that she is uncomfortable to be around me. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable or to worsen any situation. It has now been approximately 6 months, since she referred to me as creepy and weird and I just can't let it go, I think about it every day. At this point am I now the asshole for not moving on with my life? \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit - Just to clarify, I went to my direct report not Human Resources. I was hoping our boss could open a line of communication to improve the situation. My boss asked if I would like to make a report to human resources, to which I declined. \r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR - Former friend at work stopped behaving friendly, called me some nasty names and now I don't know how to act around her.

I am the middle child of two sisters in which my younger sister is at age 20 and looks very Asian. We are a white family and my dad has blue eyes and my mom has green eyes. She has deep brown eyes and almost constantly gets mistaken for being Korean. People do not believe me when I tell her she is my sister. I constantly get asked why does your sister look Asian especially growing up.\r\n\r\nIt's not that she is adopted, at least I am pretty certain this is not the case because during my childhood my mom had a best friend who was male and Chinese. He would frequently come over and give us gifts and I hardly ever saw him and my dad interacting. He was involved a lot in my little sister's childhood by bringing her gifts and we even took a trip to Hong Kong twice with him and my dad never came once. My sister looks like a spitting image of him and that's how I figured it out. I figured it out quite young and it made me not trust my mom but I never confronted her about it. This distrust caused a lot of issues in my family and I have always been seen as the black sheep child. My parents have always been very secretive about their personal lives and my family is just not a very open family. In their minds they are this perfect happy family and I haven't seen them this way in a very long time. I think they sense I dont view our family the same way and I get shunned for it. I am told I am the problem child, I am a liar, manipulative, basically my whole adolescence I felt like something was wrong with me. My older sister has especially been abusive to me. She tries to control me and always judges me. My older sister is in total denial about my younger sister ever being Asian. And my younger sister just says she trusts our parents and she thinks I am a joke as well. Anyways so I basically have always felt left out and distrustful of my family.\r\n\r\nWe are all moved out now but on Sundays we will usually do a family dinner. Last night shit hit the fan and as usual my older sister and I were fighting. This time I didn't want to hold in my anger for my older sister so I told her how I felt she was controlling and abusive to me and it has taken me a lot of work to find self-esteem after being constantly put down by her in my childhood. She was in COMPLETE denial about this saying she was never mean to me and that I am a compulsive liar and I am making up memories in my head about our childhood. This infuriated me because my whole life I have been carrying so much bullshit from them so I exploded. I never exposed the affair directly but I said this family has secrets nobody will admit. They both mostly were just laughing like I am crazy and saying \"what secrets\"? I was so upset that I took my mom to a room privately without them and we finally talked about this. I was basically like I know dad isn't her real father. She looks like a spitting image of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ etc. etc. I have never seen my mom the way she was until that night. She looked like she was almost dissociated because this stuff has probably been buried so down inside of her she thought she would be able to get away with never addressing it. Like a lot of the time she just stood there not knowing what to say. She almost tried to avoid it still and not admit it but she did admit it at the same time but not blatantly. She would say things like \"would it make a difference is she knew now?\" and yet also say things like \"oh but she looks just like our cousins\". I said \"Mom everyone knows and can see she does not look like us\". We cried. I told her I forgave her and still love her but she needs to face the truth.\r\n\r\nI think my little sister now though is very suspicious and I think the truth will now have to eventually come out.

I\u2019m not overweight, but I\u2019m definitely chubby, I\u2019m 5\u201911,  and I have a large, crooked nose and small eyes. I know I\u2019m not that attractive, but I\u2019ve come to terms with my cruel hand in the genetic lottery. Anyways, I never usually go clubbing, but it was my friend\u2019s birthday. Let\u2019s call this friend Eva. We were all dancing and having a good time when Eva approaches the club photographer and asks him to take a group picture of us. I hate taking photos because I feel really self-conscious, but it was Eva\u2019s birthday so I smiled and posed in the group photo. Fast forward a couple of days later. The club posts all of the photos from the night, including our group photo. Literally all of the other photos had no caption, but our group photo had the caption, \u201cWho\u2019s up for a game of Russian Roulette?\u201d. This was obviously alluding to the fact that I am ugly whilst my friends are all drop-dead gorgeous.

We've only been dating for a little less than 4 months, and in the first few months, we started to have issues where it felt like he was taking me for granted and not giving me affection in the way that I need. I let him know how awful it made me feel and he admitted that he struggles with a porn addiction and he was too embarrassed to admit it to me.  I read up on all the research surrounding porn addiction and suggested some ways that we could work on overcoming it together, like having an accountability partner, identifying triggers, and offering myself as a resource to talk to if whenever he felt like he needed to turn to porn. I also asked him to be more accountable for his progress by requesting that he tell me every time he messes up and watches porn. So far it's been pretty good (we've only been doing the accountability thing for 2 weeks), and he lets me know every time he messes up (which has happened 3-4 times in the past 2 weeks) and try to be supportive (usually when he lets me know, I say ok I love you and ask him what we can do in the future not to have the same situation happen again)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the problem: I have some massive issues too. I struggle with anger management and lately have been having ridiculous, out of proportion outbursts over some really stupid things. Although my anger was a problem when I was a kid, I was able to get it under control when I was a teenager and it's never been an issue in the other long-term relationships I've had. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo far, I've had 2 outbursts this week (which are really the only 2 times in our relationship that I've \"exploded\") : the first time, I let my bf use my card to pay for something because his card was declined with the expectation that he would just pay me back in cash when we got home. He asked me for a few days to pay it back, saying he needed the money to eat and get gas because he was broke. The day after, I found out that he lied and did in fact have way more money than what he said. I got extremely angry, texting him to ask for him to pay me back immediately. After he stopped responding, I then proceeded to storm into his house uninvited, take twice amount of cash that he owed me, and told him I would give him the other half of the cash back in a few days so he could see what it felt like to have a bunch of money owed that he couldn't get back. Obviously this was an unjustified reaction on my part and we fought about it for the day, ending with an agreement that that he would no longer be able to use my card for payment unless he paid me back on the spot (I've gotten upset over the same issue before but never reacted in this way previously)\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThe 2nd outburst happened a few days later, over basically nothing. We spent the night having fun and talking like we always do and he eventually fell asleep. I was being annoying asking for cuddles while he was sleeping, he (while asleep) told me that I was being annoying and had been acting ridiculous since the moment he came into my apartment and just wanted to sleep and to please leave him alone. That put me over the edge and I turned on the lights and demanded that he go home if he wanted to sleep because I was going to continue demanding affection. As soon as he left my apartment, I realized that this was an outburst and apologized to him over text, but obviously the damage was done.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the present: I know that my anger is something that is hurtful and stressful to my boyfriend and I want to fix it. I read up a lot on anger issues, the causes, and how to recognize triggers in order to de-escalate future outbursts. I've started by making efforts to not raise my voice and \"put off\" my anger for a few hours by not talking about it until I can have a clearer head about what's upsetting me (where I sometimes realize I'm totally unjustified). My boyfriend keeps reminding me about how stressful it was to him and, after admitting I knew I was wrong and acknowledging his feelings, told him that this is an issue I now recognize and am working on fixing, describing the trigger for the situation I identified and how I planned on stopping the same situation from happening in the future. He says he doesn't want to break up BUT he is demanding that I never blow up again. Realistically, I told him that I don't think I can change overnight but, if he decides to stay with me, will be transparent with him about the steps I am taking to improve myself in the hopes that one day I will have total control over my anger. I told him I couldn't give him a timeline on how long it would take me to resolve these issues because I honestly don't know. I told him I wouldn't be mad if he wanted to break up because I don't expect him to deal with my baggage, but he kept insisting that he didn't want to break up BUT I had to never blow up again.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nObviously I want to never blow up again. But I didn't want to lie and say it would never happen again, so I told him that the best I could give him was being transparent about my progress, being open to his suggestions, and asking him to hold me accountable the same way I do to him.  He cannot take this as an answer and keeps insisting that I need to \"just stop blowing up because it's hurting him\". I said it wasn't just easy to stop blowing up and that it would be ok to break up but he won't take this for an answer. I then got upset and told him to reverse the roles, and ask him how he would feel if I told him he needed to \"just stop watching porn\" because it ends up hurting me. I told him that we didn't have to be together, but if we were, I expected him to support me with my issues the same way I supported him with his: by being transparent, by being held accountable, and by actively trying to identify triggers and work on them while never attacking the other person for their flaws.

He keeps saying he doesn't want to break up but he cannot just \"give me a free pass to blow up by telling me it's ok that this might happen again\". While I feel guilty about blowing up in the first place (I know it's hurtful and entirely my fault when these blowups happen), I cannot help but feel upset that he wants to stay with me but is not willing to help me work through my issues and just expects me to magically fix them overnight when I have been supportive of his problems and never made him feel inadequate about not being able to fix them overnight. Am I justified in being upset? He seems to have dropped the topic but is this something that I should bring up again?

I expressed concerns at first, but she seemed kinda desperate and I\u2019m not actively dating either due to extensive work schedules.

We initially met at work, but now both of us work in two different facilities. Since she started at her new job a year ago she's become work friends with a mid-40s dude that I used to work with at our mutual workplace (this dude works PRN and lives five hours away from our city, relavent later). Based on my previous work experience with him this was kinda surprising as he was a fairly quiet dude and kept to himself. \r\n\r\nAround fall of last year she admitted to me she had a bit of a crush on him. I'm realistic and realize that people occasionally have work crushes when in committed relationships. I trusted her not to take things too far as if I felt I couldn't trust her with something like that the relationship wasn't one to stay in anyway. Her interactions with him were limited to at work and via text.\r\n\r\nHer and I have infrequent sex (once or twice a month) and it typically consists of her lying passively while I do my thing. Well a couple months back it was particularly passionate and something about it just gave me a sense of dread. Well two weeks back she admitted to me that not only was she thinking about her work friend during it, but she had told her work friend about it asking him if it was normal. I was taken aback and told her she needed to stop talking to him, but reassured her that we would work through this together. \r\n\r\nShe admitted to me a few days back that a few days after telling me about the first incident she texting him a nude photo of her. She tells me this photo was unsolicited and was not asked for. Again I was taken aback that 1) she was still talking to him, and 2) that she would betray my trust like that a second time. I told her she needs to stop talking to him if she wants us to heal our relationship.  I did not have any suspicion of either of these incidents. She felt guilty about what she did and came forward with it of her own volition.\r\n\r\nNow with just the above its pretty obvious that I'm NTA. However for context my fiance has never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than 3 years, we have been having our relationship issues but both sides prior have been loyal, she has been cheated on or abused in all of her relationships giving her self-esteem issues a-plenty, she has a small social circle that have mostly moved away or gotten jobs that keep them occupied more days than not. Even prior to all this she told me she values his friendship because she feels she can talk to him openly (red-flag for me when she told me that and I reinforced that I'm supposed to be that person she talks to openly). \r\n\r\nI want to give her an ultimatum between her friend and I. I love her dearly and care about her even more so I would hate what forcing her choice would do to her. Whether she loses her friend or me its going to make her spiral further in her depression.

We were graciously gifted a John Deere TRS 32 snowblower by his father. The other day while driving home from grocery shopping we were talking about how my father said our snowblower was too big for our 4 car single garage driveway. My SO said how my father was just jealous since my Dad\u2019s snowblower was so much smaller, which honestly it is and he probably is jealous. I replied that ours needed to be so heavy duty with chains on the wheels since our driveway is on a hill. To give you and idea, I have to use the e-brake when I park so as to not slide down or have a jolt when I switch transmission and when it\u2019s icy it\u2019s dangerous getting the mail. \r\n\r\nMy SO then said that without a doubt no female can safely handle that thing. Quickly he corrected himself almost in the same breath that some women could probably do it, but not me. He then said the test of usage depends on whether or not he can overtake my bicep muscles with just his three fingers. For reference I\u2019m about 5\u20193 and weigh 125lbs, can carry about 40-50lbs for a few minutes and then have to take a break. \r\n\r\nNow I\u2019ve been the most DIY and fixer-upper of our home and previous apartment. I used to mow my dads half acre lawn using a rider mower and also snowblow during the winter all myself since 18. I\u2019m a highly capable individual, or so I think. I believe that I could use the snowblower even with my current strength (which is not currently passing the usage test) just by using common sense and the mechanics of the blower (ie. use the proper speeds to navigate and turn the machine as well as the reverse to slow down). He is telling me that there is no way I\u2019d be able to stop the machine from rolling down into the street if I were to snowblow by myself. He\u2019s concerned about the momentum and condition of the driveway preventing me to stop it from moving. With all the functions in mind, he still thinks I could not stop an uncontrolled slide down the driveway since I lack the muscle strength.  \r\n\r\nSo I called him sexist and was offended that he had so little faith in me to properly handle this machinery given my previous experience. I feel like he was being an asshole for using my gender and then lack of physical strength as the reason I can\u2019t help clear our driveway. He thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for being illogically upset at his resistance to me using it due to failing his strength test, and insists it\u2019s not because I\u2019m female, but because I don\u2019t have the required muscle strength in his opinion.\r\n\r\nSo, AITA for being offended? \r\n\r\n\r\n"}, "1542": {"id": "atgtxs", "title": "AITA here?

My husband (36M)  isn't a \"talker\",  and anytime I've brought up any issues I feel WE as a couple need to work on,  his response has ALWAYS been the same \" If you feel that way we don't need to be together\" I chalked that up to immaturity he would grow out of.  \r\n\r\nNow as for the post.

The worst part is this is all AFTER I asked her if there's anything I can do/work on to make her more comfortable, nope she replies, all good. I get it that some people just want to complain so I let it go for a while, just ignoring it.\r\n\r\nWhat broke it for me was shes always alone up in her room drinking and listening to her shitty punk rock music by herself. She posts on her tumblr all the time about how shes sad and that all her friends are gone. I usually keep my distance because that's what she seems to prefer, but I texted her and asked her if shes okay and let her know that I'm a good listener if she ever wants to talk or whatever.\r\n\r\nSo she ignored my text and posted on tumblr that I'm so fucking annoying and I need to 'leave her alone and let her live her life' comparing me to her dad. LOL WHAT LIFE. From what I can tell all she does is sit up in her room and drink alone. Yeah I'm going to check into it to make sure you're not going to kill yourself or burn my house down. Who the fuck reacts that way when someone asks you if you're okay or need help?\r\n\r\nI've been nothing but kind to this girl because she seemed really lonely. I got her a space heater because my house is too cold for her. I got her a (used) bed from my parents for her birthday because she couldnt bring hers when she moved here. I'm quiet and respectful (I try anyway) and from where I'm sitting she just seems like a complete cunt. I told her she has one month to find someplace else to live as per our rental contract (she rents a room in my house, this is another favor I'm doing her because she found me on social media, I dont need a roommate but she was starting a new job here in two weeks and really needed a place).\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant. What would you do in my place? Am I a creepy cyber stalker? Am I justified in trying to find out more because shes so reserved? Blowing this out of proportion? Any responses appreciated. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Roommate has no problems with me when asks, but complains non stop on tumblr about me saying hurtful things. I'm doing her a favor here and when I saw that I gave her 1 month to find a new spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Alright in all honesty, everything I've posted is true except for the fact that I haven't actually told her to leave. I wouldnt realistically evict someone because they said some mean things about me on the internet. \r\n\r\nI'm sure shes looking for another place now anyway, but I'm not going to inconvenience her with a time frame like that. $600 is still $600 and she always pays on time. I just wanted to know what people would think if I had terminated our contract. Thanks for most responses, from the people who could respond civilly. \r\n\r\nEDIT 3: She told me about her tumblr on day one. She didnt show it to me but it wasnt some big secret.

She was fun and I knew from that time she already struggled with anxiety to the point of not being able to do some tests out of nervousness, but it was getting worse each year.\r\n\r\nWhen school ended we both went to college and we kept hanging out. We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\r\n\r\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoy. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew she wasn't well but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \"I don't want to be your friend anymore\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\r\n\r\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\r\n\r\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness. I didn't lose any other friend because of this, but I'm sure they lost any admiration they ever had for me.\r\n\r\nAt the time I felt I really needed to do it but now I can't justify this behavior anymore."}, "1550": {"id": "axa1ho", "title": "AITA for not removing a tattoo at the request of my husband?", "body": "Hello, I (31F) have been married to my husband (28M) for roughly two years, we dated for 1 year before that. In my past life before working at the church, I was a bartender at a popular bar. I made enough money to pay off my car and some credit card debt that never seemed to go away. Unfortunately, I had some issues with addiction and was not living a healthy lifestyle at the time. I had a couple of serious boyfriends and a dozen ONS before meeting my now husband.\r\n\r\nI disclosed that I had a rough time through my early to mid-twenties before we got married and was willing to be honest with him whenever he asked about anything. My husband is an old-fashioned type and follows the adage of \u201ca gentleman never asks, and a lady never tells\u201d. This was fine for me because I wanted to leave the past in the past and he wasn\u2019t a jealous type while we were dating.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have a few tattoos from the days when I was in one of my serious relationships before my current husband. He never asked about these ones, so I didn\u2019t feel like it was something that needed to be discussed. Whenever my now husband *generally* asked about my tattoos (I have a lot of them) I told him simply I liked the art, which is true. I knew when saying this in the back of my head that some of them had baggage and did not want to dig that up. At the time, I know he would have understood.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of tattoos did not come up again until a year into marriage. Because of talking about the loose associations some of them had, jealousy issues started finding their way into our relationship. Let\u2019s say one of them had to do with my ex\u2019s metaphysical snake. I love him dearly, I do. I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but these jealousy issues are starting to get cumbersome. It seems like every time he talks about this, he is possessed and wants to know all the dirty little details of this particular person in relation to himself.\r\n\r\nI feel like he is views me like I am trash, even though he is using a calm, respectful tone. I feel like when he goes deep into the rabbit hole about this, the only way to help him is to talk about the details that he is asking about. Every time it is like putting the nail in one coffin but opening up ten new cans of worms. After growing tired, I told him that I do not want to talk about it anymore. Seemingly out of anger, he told me that he wants the tattoo removed or covered up.\r\n\r\nI feel like he had his opportunity to find out about the details of all my tattoos and get them removed before the wedding. I could have been more open and forthcoming about the intimate nature of some of these tattoos, but we were seemingly operating under the don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell philosophy. But now, there are early memories and wedding pictures tainted. I am hurt by him requesting me to remove the tattoos because it makes me feel objectified. It *seems* that this is leading to an ultimatum and I have decided not to remove it. Am I an asshole for not removing the tattoo?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nYes the tattoo is about my ex's endowment.

I\u2019ve been really clear about what I wanted from the \u201crelationship\u201d from the beginning but he just seem to have ignored it. From the beginning he\u2019s been very critiquing of my body. So fair enough it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got an AMAZING body, but the first night we met he told me \u201cI never thought I\u2019d ever spend the night with a chubby girl\u201d... ever since then he on multiple occasions have been comparing my body and my sexual skills to other girls he\u2019s been with and basically always making me feel like I\u2019m ugly, fat or bad in bed.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s broken off contact because I\u2019ve been \u201ctoo immature\u201d (getting to drunk a couple of times) whilst he has criticised my friends. And my friends are 100% amazing no doubt about that.\r\n\r\nFast forward a couple of months and we live a couple of calm months with casual sex and a very good friendship. It came to a point where we were together almost 3 times a week.\r\n\r\nThen the last couple of weeks he begins to ask me to come over, bring either food or snacks, we then eat and talk a little and then he proceeds to play a game whilst I can watch tv until we go to sleep. Keep in mind I\u2019m at his place, where it takes me 30-40 minutes to get to work, and he doesn\u2019t talk to me for 4 hours until he decides we sleep at 3 in the morning and I have to be at work at 8/9.\r\n\r\nFinally one day he blurts out he misses his ex and he says that at the moment he\u2019s not interested in other girls - but maybe later. Then not more than 3 DAYS later he sends me 10 photos of this really beautiful girl that he\u2019s insanely interested in and he\u2019s going on a date with her the following week. I bite my tongue and say I\u2019m happy for him.\r\n\r\nThe day after his date I then text him to hear how it went. He then talks for an hour about how great she is, how great her body is and how amazing the sex was. At this point I \u201cflip\u201d out and tell him I don\u2019t think we should talk anymore since I haven\u2019t felt respected or appreciated the last few months - and most of all that he doesn\u2019t listen to me.\r\n\r\nThen a couple of days later, I\u2019m with my friends, we\u2019re drinking, we\u2019re going out and he texts me. He wants to know when he\u2019ll get his shirt back. I borrowed this shirt about 1-2 months ago and apparently it\u2019s one of his favourite shirts, not very expensive, but he can\u2019t get it where we live (Denmark btw). \r\n\r\nSince I\u2019m drunk and with my friends we decide to be a little ... petty about it. Later in the night I text him and apologise for my behaviour and in my drunken state I think I tell him I miss him. His response to that is \u201cI have someone else now and I\u2019m really into her. I think you should leave me alone\u201d.

Their parents still pay for rent and their share of utilities so that's not an issue, but I have to take care of all the other stuff. This has been causing me stress. I avoid comming home until late so I wont't have to deal with the mess. I have asked them to please try to clean after themselves and be more careful, to no avail. I am not a clean freak but overnight dirty dishes do me in.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow the other week the flat owner called me as our contract is about to end and he wants to know if we'll stay. I told him I would first speak to my flatmates. I went to one of them (Alice) and told her that it was \"either them or me\" but somebody would have to leave. She was totally unresponsive and stared at me blankly so I just said, alright, \"I'm leaving\". I said \"I can't keep living like this\". She left my room without a word and that was all I heard about that.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI was about to start looking for a new flat, but a third friend Charlie who also knows Alice and Bob message me three days ago telling me that he heard on good account that Alice and Bob were celebrating with joy my leaving.

She has an 8 a.m. class, and my first class is at 9 am. I've helped her arrange another ride to class, and she frequently misses it, and then I bring her in without having gone to her 8 a.m.\r\nLast night, I told her that she could not sleep in my room in my bed, in part because I wanted to have my space back. She frequently sleeps in my bed, and I don't feel like the Space is really mine, despite us paying separate rent and her having her own room. This usually upsets her when I do this, but I needed my space back for the evening even if it caused her problems. As expected, she did get upset, and stormed out of the room.

V wasn\u2019t there, so we gave a brownie to his roommate to give to him later. Before the roommate closed the door, M asked \u201cDid you know herpes has the same letters as sphere?\u201d We figured that fun fact out when she was playing that word scramble game and it was kinda funny but I was mortified that she\u2019d just say that to some guy we don\u2019t even know. He looked extremely uncomfortable and didn\u2019t seem to know what to say.\r\n\r\nWe went back to our place, and for more context my other roommate B [20F] and I share a room while M has the other to herself.

M didn\u2019t, and she demanded why I was embarrassed because I \u201cwasn\u2019t even there\u201d (I was a few feet down the hallway when she said it.) I told her he\u2019d just seen me so I know I was there and (jokingly) added would probably think of herpes whenever he saw either of us around the building.\r\n\r\nM said \u201cOh, so you\u2019re embarrassed to be associated with me?\u201d This entire time I thought it was just lighthearted joking about the awkward conversation, and I responded jokingly \u201cOnly when you talk about herpes to guys we don\u2019t even know!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis set M over the edge, and she yelled something I can\u2019t remember at me and B and stormed out of our room and into hers, slamming both doors.

She said she was going to ask V if he knew that herpes and sphere are spelled with the same letters, and I thought she was probably kidding but still told her not to, although I know V better than she does and he\u2019d probably just laugh, so I wouldn\u2019t have really minded.

I never got in a relationship with this girl, she has a reputation for being on the provocative side of things and would always play with guys, definitely not a good girl to be interested in. \r\n\r\nIn any case it\u2019s occasional for my current GF to bring up this girl (who she hasn\u2019t met before) and talk really bad about her, calling her a slut, saying she hates her, etc. \r\nShe really doesn\u2019t like her and I understand it to an extent because she\u2019s protective of me and in a way I love that she is so it doesn\u2019t really bother me.\r\n\r\nToday however we were talking about types of guys she\u2019s attracted to and as she was describing her type this guy who we\u2019ll call Mark comes up in conversation, Mark isn\u2019t exactly the most attractive guy, very odd looking and not what you\u2019d generally call attractive. I have nothing wrong with him personally whatsoever, their relationship was a long time ago. \r\n\r\nSo jokingly I tell her that there\u2019s no way she likes this guy for her looks, she says he\u2019s cute and this is where I might\u2019ve messed up, I asked if he was all there, which I definitely could\u2019ve worded better. I didn\u2019t want to say anything bad if there was something, so she tells me he\u2019s all there, he used to be blind but he can see now. I then messed up and made a dumb joke and said something along the lines of  \u201cDid he go blind looking in the mirror?\u201d And some other quip I don\u2019t remember about his forehead... oops that was probably uncalled for. We make jokes pretty frequently about other people but not mean-spirited, except for when she talks about my Ex. Anyways girlfriend goes dead silent and didn\u2019t say anything for a bit, then we get into a big discussion about what\u2019s okay and what\u2019s not. I told her I was joking and didn\u2019t mean anything bad towards him. The conversation ended with her really upset with me and me getting the impression she might have feelings for this guy who she still occasionally sees when she visits his area. \r\n\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Reddit, AITA?"}, "1559": {"id": "b1n3xi", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend\u2019s dad he doesn\u2019t care about his son?", "body": "Hi, so me (18M) and my best friend we\u2019ll call K (17M) have been friends since about first grade. We\u2019re now seniors in high school and for the past couple of years we\u2019ve been playing video games with his dad we\u2019ll call P (48M).\r\n\r\nP has always been a hard-ass but that\u2019s his personality and stuff and I understand it. It\u2019s his generation I believe and we still have a lot of fun playing video games together.\r\n\r\nSo recently my friend K, had gotten his (ex) girlfriend pregnant, and this has put a lot of stress on him. We\u2019re still in high school but he\u2019s been missing school very frequently. Now last week, P had decided to punish him for missing school so much.\r\nGood, I was completely with P for this. Instead of doing the normal punishment, he is forcing K to play a with him, every time P gets on. So we were playing one day and K said he would rather have his entire PC taken so he could get his homework done and things and P said no this was his punishment. In my eyes, this is P forcing K to play a game with him, using the punishment as the way to do it. I feel like he\u2019s being selfish, forcing K to play this game when he literally said he would rather do school related things. This had made K extremely mad and agitated constantly and obviously no one was having fun except for P.\r\nSo yesterday I got a text from a girl he\u2019s been talking to that we\u2019re both good friends with, and she told me that he has been very depressed lately and had wanted me to know about it. He said he thought his father saw him as a disappointment and all that, and so I had decided to let P know because I figured he would at least care to let K know he didn\u2019t see K as a disappointment.\r\n\r\nSo today he messaged me back after I had said \u201cHey, I think you should lay off of K for a little bit. He\u2019s just going back to being depressed apparently. Up to you but our friend said \u201cK like he thinks his dad sees him as a disappointed, and he\u2019s slacking school and he just feels different.\u201d So P said \u201cthat\u2019s life dude lol, sometimes you have to do what don\u2019t want to that\u2019s the point, he is being a disappointment\u201d and I see where he\u2019s coming from about that\u2019s life. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to help K to NOT be a disappointment. He\u2019s always been like this, where he doesn\u2019t really get involved and he thinks he should be alone on this stuff. We kept arguing and I said \u201cI was suggesting you deal with it so if you don\u2019t want to then GTFO.\u201d So he said GTFO out of what, and I had said this conversation. And he said that I had started the conversation so I said \u201dbecause I thought you cared\u201d We argued more for some time after this and I ended the conversation with \u201cLike dude, the only reason I told you this so you would lay off just a little bit.

It's not uncommon for us to go for a beer after work, as we usually do night shifts together. \r\n\r\nThere's this other girl, let's call her J. J and M are about the same age, and J started working here around December. Now one thing about Starbucks (at least, where I come from) is that dating other baristas are not allowed, because it always leads to tension and drama. I've experienced this firsthand in my previous store, and it was a really awful experience. \r\n\r\nSo the tea is that M and J have been having sexual relations for the past month or so. M told me last night when she was quite drunk. The other problem is that M has a boyfriend and J has a girlfriend. I really didn't know what to say, because I think infidelity is a pretty awful thing to do when you're not in an open relationship and I didn't want to go through the whole ordeal that is workplace romance again.\r\n\r\nI personally decided to put an end to this. I didn't know what else to do.\r\n\r\nI talked to my assistant manager the next day.

Coincidentally, she knew my other roommate from high school, so she had two friends at my apartment. \r\n\r\nWe ended things and I got a new girlfriend, but I still tried to stay friends with Megan so we\u2019d talk often. Jen didn\u2019t like this. We actually all three met up one night and had an adult discussion about it but Jen wouldn\u2019t say to her face that she was upset with Megan texting or snapchatting me every day (because she always initiated the conversation with me), instead she just said it behind her back. I realized it wasn\u2019t worth the time/effort so after at least a dozen arguments I blocked her from Snapchat after she took back her DVD player from my house so I\u2019d have a \u201creason to\u201d and that was pretty immature of me, which upset Megan. \r\n\r\nMegan would come over more often after this to \u201chang out\u201d with my roommates and wouldn\u2019t care if me and Jen were home. This bothered Jen a lot, and I had to continue listening to her complain about Megan even though I wasn\u2019t talking or engaging with her in anyway, even if she was over. \r\n\r\nShe would say things like, I can\u2019t get away from this bitch, at school (they have classes together at university), where she\u2019s always wearing the stupid Burberry scarf you bought her in front of me, and now in your apartment? Why don\u2019t you go out and tell her this is not okay? Tell her to leave. She\u2019s not welcome here. I don\u2019t like her. So this is where I might have messed up because I said, \u201cwhy do YOU care so much about this girl? You sound really insecure and I already blocked her.

I want to say it was around date 4 that he disclosed to me his history, so I was going into this relationship eyes open. I understand, I put myself in a horrible situation for a 21 year old female in college, so hold your judgement.\r\n\r\nAnyways, it all came crashing down when my parents met him. My father, who is pretty traditional, confronted him about his kids and previous marriages, which is fair. I can understand that he wanted to know more about the almost 12 year older man dating his daughter, but it wasn\u2019t an inquisitive line of questioning. It was hostile. L was calm and cool while defending his position while my father tried to physically escalate. I stepped in between them and told L to get in the car, because we were leaving. It was a 12 hour drive back to my state from my parents place. During this drive my parents unleashed something I had never seen before.\r\n\r\nMy father told me to not come home, because I was no longer his daughter. My mother warned me that I was about to be cut out of their health insurance plan. They even called the police to search my home for drugs (I only smoked weed occasionally at the time), because they would rather have me in jail than with this man. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to afford the next semester on my own, and my anxiety felt unbearable, so I ended up dropping that semester to gather myself and figure out what my next step would be as a fully independent adult.\r\n\r\nEventually I was allowed back into the family and my parents offered to continue to pay my college tuition, but no other internal resolutions were ever reached. L and I broke up a couple months later due to a job opportunity for him, and I was single again.\r\n\r\nNow when I go back to see my family, my father and mother will bring up the L situation and comment on my poor behavior and decisions. I respond by pointing out how heinous and ugly their actions were.

Around 3 days ago, I and a few of my classmates decided to go grab lunch at a shopping complex a few minutes away from school. This complex is very close to where my boyfriend goes to school, so naturally I texted him and told him that we would be having lunch near his school and he's welcome to join us. He responded in the affirmative, this was at around 1:15 pm. We get lunch and start eating and at around 1:40, I realise that it's getting late, so I text him telling him that I have to be back in class at around 2:00 pm. He responds, \"OK\". We continue eating and at around 2:00 pm I call him and tell him that are leaving, he responds with a casual \"OK\". So I go on my merry-way back to class. That evening as I'm texting him I notice that he's being very blunt and snippy. This continues up to the next morning. The next day we meet a friend, and he's (the bf) is acting normal, but I can tell something's still wrong, although I have no clue what it is. Anyway at some point in the night I force it out of him and he tells me that he had come all the way to the cafe only to get a call when he arrived that we had left. He says that he is extremely pissed off. I admit that I know this is a touchy area for him as he really doesn't like his \"time being wasted\" but still, AITA here?\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more.

However I tolerate this, as I know that when he's mad his mouth grows a mind of its own and he \"can't remember\" all that he said after he's cooled down. I was willing to let this all slide until he asked me to drive him to get his new bike from the mechanic. I was a bit apprehensive to do so as I was driving my dad's car and wanted to conserve fuel, but I agreed to it because I love him. As we leave I ask for the directions. Getting to the mechanics\u2019 is fairly simple however I am not great at directions. That said, and him being aware of this, everytime I ask him for directions I get a bunch of snide comments questioning my intelligence and it gets pretty hurtful.

He asks how he's going to get them back and I tell him that he'll get them when he gets them (I'll send them tomorrow).

Obligatory on mobile/throw away disclaimer. \r\n\r\nMy partner (31m)  and I (29f) knew we wanted to marry each other pretty early on, so we had had numerous conversations about what kind of ring I wanted. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. Not a diamond. That's all I asked. While he was designing the ring, he was making jokes about how I didn't want a diamond. I actively didn't want something traditional. Fast forward to him proposing to me, it's a diamond.\r\n\r\nFast forward a couple weeks later we were talking about the ring because it was a little too small to begin with, and I was asking him why he chose to get me a diamond instead of anything else. He said he didn't want to have to explain to people why he didn't get a diamond, that the purchase really represents him and how he values the relationship. He had the ring custom built. He chose everything about the design and stones. I mentioned that the ring is really for the recipient and not for the audience and I think this was discouraging to him because he said he thought I could change my mind about diamonds and we can just get everything changed.\r\n\r\nI don't want that, this is the ring he gave me, this is the ring he wanted to give me. It's an immensely beautiful and expensive gesture and I would never want something that he didn't want to give me. But aside from the size being too small, I genuinely do not like the design of the ring and I hate diamonds. I am blown away that he would go above and beyond to make getting me an engagement ring a massive, personal project. That's why I don't want another ring, the sentiment alone does it for me. We basically settled on he should have included me in the process.  He just wanted to make me happy, and he spent a lot of money to do it. (Which is another reason why I didn't want a diamond in the first place.)\r\n\r\nNow, I'm picking out wedding bands, the design I want does not match the engagement ring, I do not want to wear them together. \r\n\r\nI don't want to wear my engagement ring at our wedding. It's too small to fit comfortably with another ring on the same finger. I don't want to wear it on my right hand. Point blank, I dont want to.\r\n\r\nSo, WIBTA if I was honest to those who ask where my ring is? If I said it's not really my style? Any other excuse would contradict the fact that Im probably not going to wear my engagement ring much after this. It irks me that so much about weddings is showboating and I don't want to pretend. I got something I didn't want half because my partner was worried about what other people would think, and now do I have to continue that facade? Both of our mothers know how I feel about the ring. And my partner knows I probably won't wear the ring much after we get married. If that matters at all.

However, I've done some research (not a lot, I know) and found studies that suggest that cupping treatment might be no better than a placebo.

I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \r\n\r\n\r\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, or a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\r\n\r\n\r\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a long time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, et cetera. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food.

I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you.

We sat down together, had a long discussion and laid out some ground rules. We agreed that our relationship would be open for 2 weekends (so 4 days total). We agreed that there would be no continued contact with partners after sleeping with them outside of the designated days, and no flirting/setting up hookups outside of those 4 days. Too keep things less complicated, we agreed not to fuck anyone we knew. Condoms were mandatory, and we agreed to let each other know where we were going and who we were with (mainly for safety).

I do not feel comfortable with this after we agreed to stop, and I don't like the idea of doing it just to be even.

Another friend brought some molly for a few of us, this was our first time trying it but we were with a couple people who had done it before. Molly makes you very happy and confident and makes you very affectionate towards people. Jacob, his girlfriend, me and 3 others all took some. We were all talking and it came up how we each lost our virginity. I told them that I was still a virgin and that I had never had a first kiss. Jacob's girlfriend offered to give me my first kiss and I said \"no I couldn't do that to Jacob\" (who was in this conversation). He said it was fine if I wanted to since it didn't mean anything, so we started making out. Jacob saw the whole thing and kind of congratulated me afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was talking to Jacob about the party and said it was funny how I kissed his girlfriend. He had clearly forgotten about it until now and got annoyed. He told me I shouldn't of kissed her and the only reason he said it was okay was because of the molly and alcohol. I said that me and his girlfriend were also on the same drugs as him so he couldn't really blame us if that was his excuse for allowing it.

On throwaway here.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nFor context: I (23f) have been living with a host family for the past four months in a foreign country. This host family had to go through a rigorous selection process with the program I'm currently working with to host me, so it's not like my presence here is any surprise to them. I pay them each month a more than decent amount for food and rent. In a few months I may have the chance to move out, but that's not an option right now.\r\n\r\nThis host family has a fourteen year old boy who is usually home in the early afternoon every day. He does not have any friends that he hangs out with and he has no hobbies but watching YouTube and Vine compilations and listening to Bebe Rhexa and Ava Max, usually the same couple songs at least once or twice a day.\r\n\r\nBecause of my job and our location in a relatively isolated village, I am usually in the house at the same time as him every day. There is only one cafe in town, and it is not a good place for studying (it's covered in cigarette smoke and has no outlets for my ten-year-old laptop), so I usually try to do work in my room. This, however, has been rendered impossible because my host brother has rigged a stereo system to play his videos and music on thee wall adjacent to my bedroom's. Over the past four months I have tried giving him headphones, explaining that I need to study, and trying to bribe him into being quieter. Sometimes it works, but it's largely dependent on his mood, and the agreement never usually lasts longer than an hour or so.  I've taken to wearing earplugs all day and night in my house and leaving for two or three hour long walks to avoid the constant barrage of sound. I've mentioned this and a few other scuffles we've had to his parents, who are usually not home until very late at night and leave very early in the morning, they wave it off as puberty and shrug.\r\n\r\nWell, today was raining. And I've been stressing like mad about the GREs and my lack of mathematical ability. So when my host brother came home, powered up his computer and started blasting his YouTube like usual, I went out and asked him to put in the headphones I gave him. He refused and when I asked why, he said, \"Because I don't want to.\" When I told him that I didn't want to have to listen to his videos, he responded, \"Well, that's not my problem.\"\r\n\r\nGuys, I went ballistic. Full-on freak-out, F-bombs every other word. Any time I could ad an adjective, it was an expletive. Four months I've been dealing with this kid's crap and it just all came to a head. I spent a good five minutes detailing just how f\\*cking disrespectful he is as a human being. I have never in my life spoken to another person like how I spoke to him.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm hiding out in my room. All is quiet on the western front now, so I suppose that's good at least. His parents still haven't come home, but I'm waiting for when they do and we all have a really fun family get-together.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEdit: I read your comments and thought about my actions. My tirade was very emotion-fueled and I was childish myself in this situation. I decided to talk through what happened with my host brother, apologize about my outburst and explain calmly my side of the story over some chocolates. It ended up being a very productive conversation and at the end of it he apologized for being cocky and not listening to me. We finished up in a hug, and, at this point, honestly I feel like I'm the one more upset by my actions than he is.

TLDR at the bottom. \r\n\r\nFor context, my (23F) cousin (25f) has a lot of issues. She has always been a pathological liar, has trouble making decisions and being responsible, etc.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago, my cousin was sleeping with multiple people. I have absolutely no issue with that, she was not in any official relationships. She ended up becoming more serious with one of the dudes, and became monogamous. \r\n\r\nShortly after, it was revealed that she was pregnant. Her boyfriend wanted to take responsibility, and asked her to move in and marry him. They ended up getting married near the end of her pregnancy. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the tricky part. We discussed it near the middle of her pregnancy, and she told me that she had narrowed it down to 2 potential baby daddies - one of them (husband) is white, the other is Asian. She is also white. She also told me (keep in mind - pathological liar) that both guys were informed and amicable, and the hospital had done a \u2018blood typing\u2019 test but it was inconclusive because both guys have the same blood type. Firstly.. not sure that\u2019s a thing? And secondly, they would not casually do a paternity test on a fetus, it is very dangerous. \r\n\r\nMy brand new nephew is less than a month old. When he was born, it seemed very unlikely that he was white. To be fair, all babies look like little aliens, and often skin tone changes drastically. However, we have had Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people note that he looks specifically Chinese (which is where potential baby daddy\u2019s family is from) - I feel like folks with Asian backgrounds would be able to tell better than my white family. \r\n\r\nMy cousin\u2019s sister, who I am very close with, and I have been very torn. We both want what\u2019s best, and do not want to cause a divorce/etc for my cousin. However, we feel it is her husband\u2019s right to know, as he will figure it out eventually, and it is the birth father\u2019s right to know that he has a baby out there.\r\nI don\u2019t want to betray my cousin\u2019s trust, but at the same time I would not technically be at fault because she has explicitly told us, multiple times, that everyone is aware and amicable. I want to be proactive as I feel like the situation will get worse, the longer that time goes on and it becomes more obvious that the child is not white. I feel the bio dad is missing out on an important time in the baby\u2019s life. If it makes a difference, I am quite confident my cousin will reach out to him for child support, if her husband leaves her. \r\n\r\nWIBTA for casually mentioning the situation in front of the husband, perhaps by noting it is admirable he has stuck around? And WIBTA for anonymously contacting the baby daddy and letting him know about the situation? \r\n\r\nTLDR: White cousin has just birthed Asian baby. Husband is white. Should I tell husband and baby daddy what\u2019s going on? \r\n\r\nEDIT: yes, obviously the husband will figure it out soon enough and we can deal with that when the time comes.

When she is late, I end up doing nothing with my day whilst I wait for her cause I can't concentrate (I am trying to be a writer but have to do that around my job so time is off the essence), and if she straight up cancels it puts me into a spiral where I feel I'm worthless and I can't get things done/generally feel like shit.\r\n\r\nWould I be the asshole if I sent her a facebook message saying she can't see me when seeing her bf during the same trip and she can come down separately or I can come to hers occasionally to catch up.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, some of you saying it would be going too far.

I care deeply about my career and I just never feel like I can give my job 100% if I don't have a good nights sleep. They also tend to have friends over every weekend partying till 4 or 5 a.m. I'm just basically exhausted all the time.\r\n\r\nWe have gotten 3 formal noise complaints from the landlord and I've talked to them several times about a \"curfew,\" for having friends over and that we should try and respect the people living in the apartments around us.

She supported me through all of that. \r\n\r\nIn order to get help and to preserve my sanity I have talked to her family, my family, and some of my friends about some of the issues we are having. She gets upset because she is worried that these issues will put us in a bad light with my friends and family. She agrees what she is doing is wrong but she gets upset because I don\u2019t need to be disclosing everything with other people and is worried that my family will start hating her and she won\u2019t feel comfortable being around them.  I know I might be an asshole because I told some of her family behind her back. \r\n\r\nShe is going to therapy for addiction and depression. Also, I am not operating from the stance that I am perfect. I can be lackadaisical with chores and due to our issues have been depressed. Overall, I like to think that I am a good father and husband but I definitely have room for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe main issues are:\r\n She will not wake up with the kids. The kids will sometimes have to wait several hours for her.  Lately, the older one has figured out how to open up doors. I am worried that they will hurt themselves while I am working. \r\n\r\nSubstance abuse: she drinks anywhere from 3-7 days a week. Has had issues with drugs and alcohol in the past.\r\n\r\nHouse work: she has days where she just gets the kids up. Feeds them breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Then let\u2019s them watch movies and sits on her phone. Doesn\u2019t clean, do laundry, or dishes.\r\n\r\nFriends: IMO she hangs out with people that are poor influences which leads to her making poor decisions such as staying out past 12 on a week night. I don\u2019t explicitly state that she cannot hang out with these people.

Here is some context:\r\n\r\nI (f25) am in a wonderful relationship with my long time friend & ex coworker (M41) & he has 2 children. 1 boy, age 11 & 1 girl, age 6 (almost 7 in July). I love these kids to death they are both wonderful & well behaved. My bf is a single dad & has full custody of the son, & 50% custody of his daughter. I absolutely enjoy spending time with his kids & we had a lot of fun together this weekend. They draw me cute pictures & stuff & she gives me jewelry to wear so I know that his kids like me too.\r\n\r\nWhen we first got together I made it clear that sharing a bed with the kids is a boundary of mine. It caused his last marriage to have a dead bedroom issue & ultimately ended it, & I do not want that same situation for us. So whenever me & the daughter are there at the same time, before bed I clarify with BF that \"she will be sleeping in her own bed tonight, right?\" (which is literally right next door to his bedroom) He says yes & puts her to bed. He really is good with his kids & I think it is sweet. But by 2am she will wake up scared & comes into our room to wake dad up. He gets up & goes to sleep with her in her bed to help her get back to sleep. But when he does that he ends up sleeping in there the entire night! This happens Every. Single. Night.\r\n\r\nI just want to sleep next to my big warm man & snuggle. It is so comforting to me to reach over & feel him next to me. I feel that the only reason she can't sleep by herself is because her dad has gotten her accustomed to sleeping with him. She knows that if she wakes him up, he will go lay with her. So I suggested that instead of laying with her, to maybe start weaning her off of sleeping with him & instead just go in to her room, kiss her/comfort her & tell her that daddy is right in the next room & that she is safe. It seemed like a reasonable request because he has told me before that he wants her to start sleeping by herself & that she is too old to sleep with him now.\r\n\r\nBut when I suggested that, he got so angry at me @ 3:30am. He started yelling at me telling me that I don't understand because I don't have kids bla bla bla. What he seems to forget is that I was a 6yo girl once, & I am a female who was born with a maternal instinct. & it hurt because I try to be a good role model/affectionate mother figure (I would not try to replace their mother) to his children. I know he loves his children dearly & I wouldn't ever want that to change. But I really think it is time for her to be weaned off of sleeping in our bed. AITA for feeling this way? Am I really being insensitive to her needs?\r\n\r\nTLDR BF's 6yo (almost 7) daughter is so used to sleeping in dads bed that she will refuse to sleep alone in her room right next door to ours.

I got pregnant at 16 (I did use protection, but I'm one of the unlucky people, where it didn't work) and wanted to keep the child. Everyone wanted to talk me out of it, but I insisted and they let me have the child. In retrospect this was a terrible and selfish decision and I put my whole family into a bad situation. My then boyfriend (18) broke up with me 2 months before I gave birth. He only supported me sporadically over the next year. This put a lot of pressure on my family, because I was unable to earn the money needed to support the child (or myself), nor could I handle it all on my own. I talked over this with my family and nobody of us wanted to give the child into foster care. My brother offered to support me financially as soon as he entered the job market, while my mother stopped working for 3 years to help me raise the child.\r\n\r\nFast forward. My brother held his promise. He got a great job and later went on to start his own business. He bought an apartment 6 years ago and lets me and my daughter live there rent-free. I myself didn't do very well, I got really depressed and couldn't work. My brother paid for my therapy and through his business network he also got me a part-time job right next to where I live when I got better.\r\n\r\nFast forward to today. My brother (32) is pretty much working all day from Monday to Friday, but almost every weekend he will spent time with me and my daughter (11). This is always the highlight of the week for my daughter. I can't afford a lot of things, but my brother has no problem taking her to whatever she wants (waterparks, horse riding, shopping designer clothes). My daughter adores him. Until recently this all worked out well, but my daughter got so used to this standard of living and in combination with entering puberty she started to get really disrespectful towards me. When she's angry with me, she always threatens that she'll move to her uncle. A few weeks ago she claimed that I was always being rude to her in front of me and my brother and that he should marry her to save her. My brother just laughs and jokingly tells her that if she doesn't change her mind when she's 18, he will, and then my daughter turns to me and sticks out her tongue. I subtly asked my brother on 2 occasions to stop spoiling her so much. The first time he told me that children should be happy. The second time he told me that \"I was quite the princess at her age as well\" and proceeded to laugh. I then talked to my parents. They immediately sided with my brother and reminded me how much he has done for me. They told me that I would be out of my mind if I damaged their relationship. This really hurt me. I'm 28 and have really nothing to show for in my life. I'm incredibly grateful for what my perfect brother has done and is doing, but I fear that I'm slowly going to lose my bond with my daughter."}, "1610": {"id": "bk5lj6", "title": "AITA for wishing my friend (24F) didn\u2019t follow my partner (23M) and I (27F) to live in a tropical island because she\u2019s making our time here a bit shit?", "body": "So I have this friend (let\u2019s call her Amy).

Our relationship was going great (or so I thought). At this point, we both knew each other's family's really well, we'd gone on several vacations together, and I honestly thought he was the person I was going to marry. Then, Patrick dropped the bomb on me that he'd been cheating on me with Mike. I was in a state of total shock\u2014not only did I trust both Patrick and Mike, I had no idea Patrick was gay/bi. Needless to say, I was devastated. However, because we'd been together for so long and I cared so much about him, I told him it was okay, we could work it out.\r\n\r\nPatrick and I stayed together for about a month longer, until he dumped me, in public. He told me the reason for him dumping me was my fault, and I was too needy and too boring.\r\n\r\nWell, I honestly lost it. I cried nonstop, and when three of my very close friends asked me what had happened, I told them the complete and honest truth about how he had cheated on me. All three of them decided to cut off ties with Patrick. When Patrick heard that I had told them, he called me out for being a bitch and trying to turn them against him. Nowadays, he still comes to the same parties as me (most of our friends still don't know) and surrounds himself with the same people, which means I have to see him all the time.\r\n\r\nThis entire experience has been awful for me. My one saving grace was the knowledge that Patrick would move away from the city where our college is after his graduation. As far as I know, he and Mike are still together. Patrick is not necessarily secretive about being gay/bi (not sure which, honestly), but he's not exactly out and proud about it either. Only, now I just found out Patrick got a different job offer in this city, so he's going to stay in the area and planning on spending a lot of time on campus.

We've been together for almost 3 years but this is our first time living together. Obviously we have spent a lot of time at each other's places, but never had \"our\" own home.\r\n\r\nWe are discussing how to share responsibility for household chores and hit a snag. Which brings me here. I will try and be fair to both sides.\r\n\r\nI like to cook. And I'm good at it. Really good at it. It's one of my primary hobbies and I enjoy it immensely. I make everything from scratch and am pretty capable with most 'types' of cuisines. I serve restaurant quality shit, if I do say so myself. GF cannot cook at all. So I do 100% of the cooking, usually 5 nights a week we eat at home.\r\n\r\nTypical routine for me is to get home from work around 6:00, spend about an hour cooking, and GF and I eat dinner around 7:00-7:15. She gets home at the same time and uses that hour to unwind by herself. The cooking is my way of unwinding; I find it relaxing. I also do all the clean up, since I'm pretty good about cleaning as I go and just rinse stuff out and load the dishwasher as I'm cooking. After we eat, I throw in the dinner plates and wipe the counter down and I'm done.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing chore division, I say that I spend an hour a day cooking and that counts as a chore. GF disagrees. Says since I enjoy cooking and it's my hobby, it's not a chore. \r\n\r\nI, obviously, disagree. Yes, I enjoy cooking. But I think it's still a chore. And she's reaping the benefits from it. She points out that she was perfectly happy subsisting on microwavable food before she met me, and it's my choice to cook. I point out I'm a guy, and my tolerance for bathroom cleanliness is far, far different than hers, so does that mean she shouldn't count cleaning the bathrooms as a chore? She says she doesn't enjoy cleaning the bathrooms, and she doesn't claim her hobbies like knitting as a chore. I say her knitting doesn't benefit \"us\" or \"our home.\" She says enjoyed hobbies cannot count as chores.\r\n\r\nThus, we are at an impasse.\r\n\r\nGF agrees I should get 'credit' for the cleanup and dishes, but not for the actual cooking. I want 'credit' for all of it.\r\n\r\nWho's the AH?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Maybe credit is the wrong word. We are trying to divvy up chores equally, so there has to be some way to divide them.

She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.\r\n\r\nBut then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine.

We were laying on his twin bed since there wasn't much space, so we were touching hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder.

At one point his arm was pushed right up against the side of my chest and I also was sort of leaning my head on his shoulder. We were talking and joking about stuff like we always do, and at one point he made a comment about how much my hip bone sticks out (I'm pretty thin) and started feeling it up, then apologized. I laughed it off and felt to see how much his hip stuck out compared to mine. It was funny but still a pretty stupid conversation. \r\n\r\nOverall though, I was really glad to be there because I missed our friendship, but I had this nagging feeling that if his gf were to theoretically walk in on us, she would be pissed.

Nothing else happened. \r\n\r\nThen came a plot twist: I noticed the next day that we are no longer Facebook friends. It could have just happened or been a few weeks since I noticed, I have no idea.

I felt uncomfortable with that and told him not to wait because I didn\u2019t want to feel pressure to hurry up and get over my heartbreak, but he said waiting was his only option as he couldn\u2019t see himself with anyone else.

I disagreed since there was no physical aspect, and since I was fooling around with other people on a purely NSA basis. He flipped out on me and told me he had waited long enough, and done everything he could to support me through my heartbreak and help me feel ready to date again and unless I gave him a chance he would cut off contact with me.

It happened after he got really upset one night, he literally burst into tears and said he was finding it really humiliating to have such strong feelings for someone who didn\u2019t have any for him. He said he felt pathetic and thought everyone was laughing at him behind his back. I felt shitty about him feeling that way, especially since I DID have feelings, so I told him.

Every time I would cry and tell him I want to tell my sister he would say she wouldn't understand and that it would only hurt her. It became a stupid cycle where I would come over, tell him I wanted to stop this and confess, I would cry, he would comfort me and we would have sex. (He didn't care about me. I am just an idiot for feeling more than I should have.)\r\nFast forward a few months after quitting and getting space, he left his girlfriend and is now dating my sister seriously. I spoke to him about there relationship. I asked him if he would cheat on her like he did the other one. He said he has been good so far but he loves women. I feel like I am being crushed by this lie but he said it would break her heart and that she would be more angry with me than with him. Basically saying that she would never speak to me again but most likely forgive him. He is very charming. \r\nWIBTA for confessing months later to her? I just feel so bad. And so stupid. She deserves better than both of us but what's done is done. He thinks it would be unneeded pain for me and that it wouldn't change what they have so it's best to just keep my mouth shut.

We both were in the same STEM program and had most of our classes together. Including this one stats class with a very attractive prof. Neither of us ever saw her outside of class or said anything much more than hello to her for the entire semester but my friend slowly started to bring her up more and more talking about how much he was into her and how it was obvious she was into him. I thought this was pretty ridiculous and I constantly told him he was full of it. Never thought he was entirely serious.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nAnyway the semester ended and he graduated before I did. He would still bring up this prof occasionally and talk about how he needed to hit her up now that he was out of school. I told him \"you can't be serious\" like I always did, and he dropped it like he always did. Then one day, near the end of my semester,we're at a bar, drinking and he asks me if I will give her a note for him since I'm on campus still and it will save him a trip. I say sure, why not. He gives me a folded piece of paper and I tuck it away without much thought since we were in the middle of a different conversation.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo the next day I'm home and I read the note. It's like a love letter but it's just this blunt, wildly inappropriate, excruciatingly forward, cringeworthy mess. To give you an idea how bad it is, it contains a sentence about how she soothed his inner demons immediately followed up with how she made him feel sexually.

At first I think that I'm going to return the note, tell him what a bad fucking idea this is and why he shouldn't do this. But then I start thinking about how delusional he must have been to write this in the first place, how I've been discouraging him for a year now to stop acting like this prof is into him and it has never deterred him once, to the point where he still thought it was a good idea to write this. I thought that if I confronted him, he'd probably just deliver it himself.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo I decide that it would be both more effective and easier on me if I just act like I delivered it, so that when she doesn't get back to him, he'll assume she rejected him and move on.

My husband and I live in a different country to my family, so we sent out invitations a year in advance so people could plan ahead, book accommodation, flights and time off work etc. The invitations asked people to RSVP via email (we had an email account specifically for RSVPs, so had no pre-existing contacts.) \r\n\r\nThe reason we wanted email RSVPs is because we planned on sending out an email, detailing the dress code and how to get to the venue. This included bus routes and taxi companies. We were attempting to make things easiest for out of towners. Other details about the day were included in the email. \r\n\r\nLiterally everyone else RSVP'ed. My husband's family, my best man, all other wedding party members and siblings. Everyone but my Mum! They all did it because they knew we wanted to send out this email. \r\n\r\nI reminded my Mum and explained this too her every time I spoke to her for the past freaking year! She just kept on telling me that she would do it. I sent her a text a few days before the email was due to go out, asking her to do it. She didn't reply and didn't RSVP. \r\n\r\nThe email went out to everyone except her, and guess who is now ignoring my calls? \r\n\r\nI know I'm being a baby.

I'm making this edit because I found out today that one of my husband's groomsmaids didn't RSVP formally either, so she didn't get the email.

The groomsmaid lives locally, so it doesn't apply to her. There were some other details in the email, but I don't think it's anything she (or my Mum) doesn't already know. She asked if there was anything she needed to know, we told her not really and asked if she wanted us to forward it to her, she declined. \r\n\r\nIf my Mum had called/texted me, said she didn't get the email, apologized and said she wanted it, I would have sent it to her. Instead she's decided to throw a tantrum and act like I'm deliberately leaving her out. \r\n\r\nWhen she's speaking to me again, I'll talk to her about it and find out if she still wants it.

Stupid on both of our parts to allow that to slide.\r\n\r\nOn my end, I guessed I wrongly assumed there would leniency or it could be let go, considering the relationship has been over for so long. The problem is the means by which to calculate exactly how much is owed. Neither of us can really prove exactly what on this breakdown is true or false, and the entire process is being negotiated (with me questioning certain facets of the breakdown/debating over the total amount etc.) She is claiming the total that I owe is $500 ($495.00 to be exact). In terms of why this has taken so long - several reasons:\r\n\r\n**1.** We have had a lot of conflict/resentment and at points she would treat me like shit. **2**.She comes from a fairly well to do family, and hasn't been working. I have been working my ass off and still am **3.** She has had conflict with my current partner due to jealousy/projection and has really infringed on my relationship whenever I have continued to attempt being friends with her **4.** At some points because of 1/2/3.

I am currently in school, getting a second degree (allllllmost done), because one tiny human has significant special needs and being the one that cares for the kiddos 365 days a year, I couldn\u2019t maintain my first career (little to no sick leave, inflexible schedule,etc.).\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s currently taking me to court to seek a reduction in child support because I am in a different state (state A) than where our divorce occurred (state B), and they have much different guidelines, he would owe half the amount he pays in state B, and at this point none of the child support reflects his $40,000 a year increase in pay . During mediation, he basically said that he can\u2019t have a relationship with the kids because I have them too far away (5 hours), and that his job requires him to travel at a moments notice, etc., and that it\u2019s not fair that he\u2019s being seen as a paycheck, and that the amount he currently pays isn\u2019t fair. He\u2019s blaming me for being too far away and that this is all my fault, basically.\r\n\r\nMore info: Our oldest kiddos care providers have stressed that inconsistency is terribly damaging to him psychologically, and causes meltdowns and aggression, which means that when ex just randomly shows up or calls once every few months, it sends kiddo into 3-4days of emotional turmoil/behavior, which I\u2019ve shared with my Ex, as well as asking him to try to be consistent in visitation, trying to explain that he can\u2019t just pop in and out every few months and expect the kids to have a relationship with him.\r\n\r\nI told him that he can\u2019t keep his current position if he wants to have a relationship with his kids and repair damage that\u2019s been done (he stated that he feels like damage is done and he can\u2019t fix it).

He is military, and at the time the marriage imploded I went home (we had Just moved to the state and new next To no one) to give us some space from each other, and since I was the primary caregiver the kids went with me. I didn\u2019t even want a divorce initially, he said he wanted a 6 month separation, and within a few days of me going home he essentially ghosted me for 4 months, broke our lease, and moved and didn\u2019t tell me where he went.

She spent too much money on the shrimp and got the wrong size, did not pick up all the ingredients so I had to run out and get more, and added too much water to the rice. The breaking point for me was when she messed up the sauce and made it extremely watery when it was supposed to be stickier . So I was a little annoyed and when my family came down to eat my mom told me to chill out and shut up. I agreed and spooned rice into a bowl and then used the same spoon for the dish. My brother gets angry and says I messed up the rice by using the same spoon. I, already in a bad mood, rolled my eyes to which my mom yelled at both of us to knock it off. I got mad and said I didn\u2019t do anything and said I can\u2019t wait for my house to be ready to which she replied that no one else wants me in this house anyway. I said okay and left to eat alone on the porch, admittedly and not proudly beginning to cry and I know my mom would get angry at me for that. \r\n\r\nLater that night she called me into her room to ask why I could not at least try to enjoy my time here. I told her that I was trying to be helpful and was just getting annoyed earlier at everyone\u2019s comments and mistakes.

Obviously, I wanted to make sure the price wasn't going to be too high, as I don't want to make my bridesmaids go over budget. This is where my aunt (53) comes in. My aunt, who is also my godmother, has always been bossy and pushy. She went to the fabric store and asked for the fabric I had initially chosen for the dresses (her daughter [23f] is a bridesmaid and my aunt fully supports her financially), but before buying it she called me. Now, I had told all my bridesmaids that I would buy the fabric once I had spoken with the tailor, because I wanted to make sure of the price. I tell her this on the phone, and ask her to wait until the next day in order to buy it.

I immediately told her this was going to be a problem, because I need someone who agrees to sew 6 dresses, not 1, in 2 weeks, and that I wanted them to wait until the next day so that I could verify the price again or, worst case scenario, go dress shopping at a local boutique. Now, I wouldn't mind her using a different dress than the other bridesmaids, and I agreed to it initially because I felt bad for her spending money on the fabric, but the only dress I found for all of my bridesmaids did not match that fabric at all, and I have already spent a lot of money on my wedding for a simple detail like this to throw off the wedding theme. I called my cousin and told her that I was sorry, but that I was choosing another dress for all bridesmaids. She was ok, but my aunt called me right after that and started screaming at me, saying that I was choosing other people before her, and that she had spent a lot of money on the fabric, etc. I got angry and told her I advised them to not buy the fabric in the first place, to which she responded that she was not going to continue the argument and hung up on me. I called my cousin and told her, in a calm manner, that I hoped she could understand the situation, to which she responded she did, and that she was going to buy the dress. My aunt later texted me saying that she was going to buy my cousin the dress, and I responded to her text saying to send me a receipt for her purchase at the fabric store, so that I could buy the fabric off her.

She did exactly that until my mom went to bed and she got annoyed that my mom also expected to sleep in her own room too, despite that being the agreement all along. \r\n\r\nShe screamed at me and told me I\u2019m a lying c**t for saying I\u2019d ever have slept on the couch in the first place and to get out of her sight, so I\u2019m in my room, I\u2019ve had to change the bedsheets, clean up after her mess completely and throw out all the rubbish she collected in the two nights she\u2019s been in my room, but I\u2019m still itching at the fact there\u2019s been food in my room and can\u2019t concentrate properly. \r\n\r\n\r\nAITA for kicking her out my room over the fact she ate in here?"}, "1656": {"id": "c1k4qo", "title": "AITA for telling a girl not to bait us with cancer?", "body": "For context, I (M16) am in a group chat with this one girl (F15) that I don\u2019t particularly care for, and some classmates. I don\u2019t really like the girl and some things she\u2019s done, but I try and keep it respectful between us.\r\n\r\nThe group chat was filled with various chatter. At one point, the girl in question (We\u2019ll call her T) chimes in with a dark message. She goes \u201cThis is so sad but someone at our school has cancer.\u201d This immediately grabs our attention for obvious reasons.  We ask if she\u2019s kidding and a couple of guys start to make jokes about who it is ( as in they are saying it\u2019s them or someone in the group), but she confirms she is serious. We keep asking to make sure she is 100% serious, and she is. We ask her how she knows, and she says she just heard it directly from the person while she was visiting. A friend of mine (We\u2019ll call him Z) asks who has cancer. T refuses to tell us. Immediately half of us go \u201cthen why did you bring it up?\u201d Z asks a few more times and T says she won\u2019t tell us. A few other get upset with Z, arguing that if she doesn\u2019t want to tell, she doesn\u2019t have too. That\u2019s fair, but she just dropped a bombshell on us. So Z and some others argue that you shouldn\u2019t say something so significant if you don\u2019t want to talk about.\r\n\r\nT goes on a rant. She starts saying that she can say whatever the hell she feels like saying and we should get off her back. Others are saying that it\u2019s dumb to say \u201chey guess who has cancer\u201d and then move on as if that means nothing. T is saying that it\u2019s not her fault that Z wants to know which of our classmates has cancer, which is objectively false because he wouldn\u2019t have known anything about it if she didn\u2019t bring it up (unprompted, btw). Then T starts complaining that we always do this to her. She\u2019s referring to an earlier incident where she posted a picture of something from an ongoing trail involving someone we know on the group chat, then she started complaining when we were talking about the trail that she brought up. We all pointed out that if she didn\u2019t want us to talk about it, she shouldn\u2019t have shown us something we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have seen.\r\n\r\nShe goes on and on and I finally speak up. I say that it\u2019s stupid to drop a bombshell like that and expect us not to discuss it. I then say that Z is completely in the right for asking for clarification on information freely given by T and that it\u2019s childish and frankly immoral to bait us with someone having cancer then blaming us for wanting info. She loses it, saying that she had the right to say whatever and that she\u2019s \u201cdone with all of you\u201d and she leaves the chat. I felt justified but later Z said that we really pissed her off. I felt the incident was entirely her fault, but the group chat is split. I\u2019ve been toying with the thought that while she did bring up the topic, it\u2019s her right to give and decline information when she wants to, even if it\u2019s about a mutual friend having cancer.

She works hard and is always down to help out with school work, extra curriculars, or anything else we may need. Overall, she prides herself on being extremely helpful and on top of things, almost to a fault. I\u2019ve had conversations with her about her easing up on everything and just letting me handle things, but she always wants to be helpful and involved in some way, whether it be researching job opportunities or editing my essays or even looking up health studies and advising me on my diet and exercise habits. In short, she is a model parent, and I could not be more lucky.\r\n\r\nToday, however, I finally lost my cool, over something really really stupid. Basically, I had this pair of blue converse which I use for working out (I do StrongLifts 5x5, and these are the reccomended shoe, so don\u2019t judge my fashion). I\u2019ve worn them about for a few months and they\u2019ve sort of become \u201cworn in\u201d, if you know what I mean. Personally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with using a pair of shoes for a few years, unless they stop fitting or something, and since I mostly use them to work out, I don\u2019t see a problem with them being a little worn down. This morning, however, when I went to get to my shoes, I found they were missing. I looked around for them and found that they were nowhere to be found. At this point, I was mildly annoyed, so I called my mom and asked her if she knew where they were. She told me, point blank, that she threw them out, and when I asked her why, she said it was because they smelled bad (gross, I know), and that they looked ratty. When I heard this, I was furious. For one, I was mad that she had thrown out a pair of obviously functional sneakers without consulting me about it, since I was the person to whom the sneakers belonged in the first place ( and the person who was using them). I was also uncomfortable at the fact that she was poking around in my closet, smelling my shoes, without my knowledge. The whole situation peaved me. I know she\u2019s my mother and that she was just trying to help, but the idea of someone smelling my things and deciding to throw them out makes me feel a little invaded. I snapped at her over the phone and used some colorful language to express my annoyance. \r\n\r\nI realize that I wasn\u2019t at my most mature in that moment, but tell me, o wise redditors, was I justified in being annoyed? Is this something mothers usually do, or is this overreaching certain boundaries?

I dress a bit more masculine than a lot of girls, but I like to be pretty and dress in cute clothes sometimes too.\r\n\r\nI had my hair very short for a long time, but I recently grew it out a little below my shoulders.

My sister told me I am NOT to wear a tux, that we are all wearing dresses. I never even brought up wanting to wear a tux EVER in my life. I don't like dresses but I do wear them for formal events.\r\n\r\nAnd now today: my uncle was talking with me. He was asking how I'm supposed to get ripped if I don't eat meat. I brought up that I'll be seeing him in 4 months again (for the wedding) and I'll show him that you can be muscular and not eat meat. \r\n\r\nMy sister busted in \"No.\" \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean no?\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to be buff for my wedding.\"\r\n\r\nOkay no one can get incredibly defined and massive in 4 months..

He is an amazing father to our daughter and I give him nothing but props for that.\r\n\r\nThe sticky shit comes into our income, me (32 F), make a bit more than him (33 M), as such I have had to bare a lot more of the financial burden, despite him reassuring me in the beginning of our relationship that I would never have to carry him.  This became an issue and, as far as I believe, became the thing that ended our relationship. \r\n\r\nFast forward...we are both mature adults and love our child very much. She is and will alway be the most important thing to us, so we get along fairly well. His bithday is this weekend. I thought for a send off we would do something for his birthday. \r\n\r\nHe picked dinner and a strip club. No problem. We both were not super hungry so we went to a local bar and grabbed a few drinks and an app. I paid for the whole tab. Then went to the strip club, I took out 200 and gave him 60 in cash for singles, I paid for covers and drinks. I also bought him 2 private dances.\r\n\r\nI ran out of cash, when I went to the ATM despite having money in my account the ATM said I had \"exceeded my withdraw limit\" so I could not get any more cash. I told him we had a few options. 1) we Uber (we had both been drinking) to the nearest location of my bank and hope the ATM there lets me take out more, or 2) we go home because I was out of cash. He then tells me he has $100 he can spare in his account and to just Venmo me later. \r\n\r\nThis kinda triggers me and let me explain why. For my 30th (my last BD) he paid me back for tickets to a concert and called this his present. I honestly don't really like the band, but he does. He begged me to buy tickets to this show for weeks and just because it was close to my birthday he presented it as his birthday present to me. Honestly I felt cheated of my 30th. So I paid 100% for a trip to NYC to see a show I actually wanted to see, including food/hotel/ticket for us both. \r\n\r\nI cried most of the Uber home, which I paid for,  I just feel used.

We used to hang out or at least talk a few times a week, now I\u2019m lucky if he even responds to my messages even though I know for a fact he sees them as his fianc\u00e9 has told me countless times he sees them but just ignores people\u2019s messages.

I often refuse help if i can because i hate relying on people due to things in my past which my cousin is aware of but I didn\u2019t really have any other options so on Tuesday i asked them if one of them could take me to work as i had an early shift on Wednesday it was at 8:30am I know that\u2019s not really early but i work nights because it\u2019s when i have transportation available, They said that one of them would take me and that was that I figured i could rely on them but i was wrong, Come Wednesday morning i get ready for work and try to get ahold of them both at 7 only for them to both ignore my multiple calls over the next 40 mins.

My wife thinks I'm the asshole because I paid for my own daughter's wedding. However I don't think that's a fair comparison. My daughter's wedding cost about $5,000 and was a quite modest event, although we all had fun. My stepdaughter's wedding would cost nearly twenty times that. Let me reiterate that I love my stepdaughter the same, and that I have absolutely nothing against people with Autism, or BPD as long as they seek treatment. But she's booked all the concessions already, so if I'm not paying for it it's likely she'll have to file for bankruptcy. She doesn't know yet.

Last night she came home from speaking with a woman about a part time job. This job is dog watching in this woman's apartment, for 2 hours a day. She is offering 12 per hour, 5 days a week. Sounds fine, but the problem is this woman lives 43 miles away. And to be fair, we live far out from town, usually an hours drive from anywhere worthwhile.\r\n\r\nShe comes home and we talk about this job, and I look up the address as to where she would be going. With that long of a distance, and her car being a 99 Buick (20 mpg at best), I tried to explain that it's just not worth it, it's practically working for free. If you are guaranteed to burn 4-5 gallons of gas a day, at a cost of 2-3 dollars per gallon, you're looking at a profit of under $20 per day. Her car has over 200k miles, has issues, but me being a mechanic, I've taken steps to try to prolong it's life as long as possible. I need it to last at least til next year, when I plan on buying her something new.\r\n\r\nI explained that we need her car to keep running as long as possible, because she starts school in August and that it's not worth the effort for such low pay.  I net $60k a year, and pay for all expenses. We live in a low cost of living area. She has access to our checking account where if she wants to buy something, she can. She quit her job a few months ago because it was a bad environment and she wanted to mentally prepare for full time school starting in August.\r\n\r\nShe didn't really respond to what I said, I got an eye roll and she proceeded on to cooking dinner/lunch for me to take to work. I go shower for work, on the outside I'm calm but inside I'm fuming. I've had anger problems before, and what has worked for me is getting out of the situation. I didn't eat dinner (which was still left on the counter this morning when I got home), I didn't say anything, I just left. I go to work, and get a msg from her asking: \"what did I do? what the fuck\". My response was \"sorry was getting angry, I needed to leave.\"\r\n\r\nI then explained why I was upset, that I don't feel she's taking my opinion seriously, when this decision affects both of us. I gave her my GI bill to get a nursing degree, so if she fails these classes because she doesn't have transport to get to school, that has to be repaid. Working for almost nothing is not worth the time or expense, if you want to get out of the house there's options, the local animal shelter has tons of volunteer opportunities if you want to hang out with dogs. We need that car to stay running, I can't afford to replace/overhaul it and less than $20 per day isn't worth the mileage. I said all of these things to her, by text.\r\n\r\nHer response was basically how I'm controlling just like every other guy she has been with. That she's \"sorry for trying to help out\", \"sorry for trying to get a job she'd enjoy\" and ended with a nice \"fuck off\". I should have been calmer before leaving the house, but I just couldn't.

We\u2019ve been in the complex for a little over a year now. There are about 10 units in the building, all different races and ages live here\u2014a brother and sister, a couple of guys around our age, some families with kids, some older people. On our side of the building, everyone has a balcony or patio; we are on the second floor and often sit out on our balcony. The sidewalk below us, between our building and the next, is visible most of the time from where we\u2019re sitting.\r\n\r\nThe issue: my boyfriend and I are pretty big pot smokers. Smoking is not allowed in or around the building, but I know people in at least two of the other units smoke pot, and a bunch of men smoke cigarettes outside & in the stairwells, including the father who lives beneath us with his two girls and wife.\r\n\r\nSo last night, I got home from work around 9pm and we go out to the balcony to enjoy the bong\u2014it\u2019s Friday night, after all. Now, we NEVER smoke when the children are outside, but sometimes it\u2019ll happen that we start smoking and THEN the kids come out and start playing, in which case we start freaking out, try to wave the smoke away, go inside, etc. So of course last night, the girls came outside a few minutes after we had been smoking. It\u2019s about 9:10 at this point, and my boyfriend & I are just sitting in the chairs chatting, we hide the bong and obviously don\u2019t smoke anymore since the kids are out. The girls are playing on the sidewalk downstairs, and after a few minutes the mom comes out and is talking to them in Armenian. I hear one of the girls ask, \u201cwhy are there people upstairs?\u201d The mom says a bit loudly in English, \u201cthey are smoking,\u201d and brings the girls inside a minute later.\r\n\r\nWe both felt really bad.

I hate thinking we\u2019re the bad guys here. Part of me wants to dismiss the mom, I can judge her for a few things myself; my boyfriend said during the earthquake last night the kids were all running around outside on their own.

A small, kitchen and bathroom, a closet for some shared stuff, a closet for our clothes, a little dining table, a desk with my boyfriends computer where he works and a tv cabinet.\r\nWhen we moved in, I made most of the decorating choices but also tried to take his preferences in consideration. The problem arose with the tv cabinet. The tv has literally not been on for the past year, it has not even been connected yet. He said he wanted to use it to play games and watch movies but it has not happened. \r\nI told him 4 months ago that if the tv would not be used in the next 3 months it had to go.

Inside were a couple of packets of biscuits that I like, and a plastic bag of my favourite pick and mix sweets (like 200g or so). There wasn't a card and they weren't wrapped. One important thing to note is he's been buying me these specific biscuits once a fortnight or so as a kind of in-joke (I'm a redhead and they're ginger kisses) so it wasn't a special treat or anything. For context I have always put a lot of effort and thought into gifts for him - pop vinyls of his favourite characters, a handmade scrapbook, new expensive cologne one year, etc. I don't expect him to spend a lot of money at all, it's the thought that matters to me. I expressed thanks and was enthusiastic but I felt underwhelmed and kept it to myself until a few hours later when he commented that I was quieter than usual and pressed me to tell him what was wrong. I said \"look, I'm not ungrateful and I appreciate that you got me something but I just feel a little disappointed because it's literally the same thing you get me every other week to be cute and it sort of feels as though you didn't really put much thought into it\". He got upset straightaway, accused me of being materialistic and entitled, said he didn't have much money at the moment, that I said I didn't want anything, that he wouldn't bother next time, etc. We've since made up and the topic hasn't been raised again but I felt and still feel awful and as though I must be materialistic.

She was informed that if she messed up again she could be suspended or expelled.

Every time we hang out I get increasingly more suspicious that he likes me. The fact that he's married is the only thing that keeps me from being 100% certain he likes me. He keeps asking me to go out after work, and eventually, I end up saying yes. On one hand, he's a co-worker and a potential connection for the future, and suddenly cutting it off could have consequences (especially if we work together in the future). Plus, it's nice to be treated to food, and I know for a fact I'm safe when I'm with him (let's just say this is a hypothetical condition). Also, like I said, he is a nice person to talk to, especially when I'm alone here otherwise. But to be clear, I have no intention of pursuing anything with a married man. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for continuing to go out with him. Obviously if I were in his wife's situation, I wouldn't like me at all. But I don't consider what I'm doing to be stringing him along since 1) I'm so many years his junior and think that'd be a huge assumption considering the work situation we're in, 2) I've specified many times I consider him a friend. Am I in the wrong for continuing to go out with him?\r\n\r\nTldr; AITA for continuing to go out with an unhappily married man with romantic feelings for me for free food and company?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I described my work as an internship, but to clarify a bit more, it's a research internship.

It started off innocuous enough; he watered down my milk, I put sugar in his salt shaker, etc. This wasn't a constant thing, we're talking he would do something, maybe a few weeks or a month or two would go by and I'd get \"revenge\", but most of the time it wasn't a thing. Well, things escalated. He asked to borrow my laptop and I allowed him to. We've always been good buddies and our friend group is pretty frank and open, so I didn't think to delete my browser history or sign him into a guest account. He \"pranked me\" by taking a screen cap of my browser history, showing some explicitly named links to fetish porn, which he then posted to my facebook wall. Several friends and my brother-in-law saw it before I took it down 45 minutes later after checking Facebook on my phone. It's not something I would willingly have put out there, but the damage was minimal so I thought no real harm done, I'll just get even.\r\n\r\nIn response, I made a fake profile as a woman on a dating app that I knew he used, using digitally altered photos of real women (modified so that nobody's actual face or any identifying features were visible). Eventually, I matched with my buddy, which I knew would happen, and we started flirting back and forth over a few days via text on a Google voice number I set up, gradually getting more explicit. Eventually, I convinced him to send me a photo of himself masturbating. Afterwards, I ghosted him and deleted the profile.\r\n\r\nHis birthday was this past weekend. I had him and a few of our close drinking buddies over for beers. I had had the photo printed onto a t-shirt and gave it to him as a wrapped gift, which he opened in view of our friends. Everyone laughed and told him to try it on, but he got super pissed and stormed out.\r\n\r\nHe texted me later telling me I had crossed a line and we're no longer friends, but I don't see how what I did was substantially different from his joke. I told him that I actually thought his was worse, since our friend group goes camping together and frequents the same gym, and we've all seen each other undressed, whereas he embarrassed me in front of friends who weren't as close, and my brother-in-law.

The second week he was here he had his friends over at every single night from about 10.30 to past 12, usually 1am. That week I got incredibly sleep deprived. I'm an incredibly light sleeper so I just can't sleep if I hear noise - and we share a really thin wall, so I can hear everything. So each night I had to stay awake until his friends left and a lot of the time, I had work the next day which ended up in me having to leave work early one of my shifts as I just couldn't function. I can't fall asleep to music as it's too noisy, and my excellent noise cancelling headphones can't even block him out (though I'm not playing music when I wear them so obviously they don't work remotely as well). After that week of no sleep, I asked him if we could compromise - maybe he could cut down on having friends over and on the nights he did, he could let me know and I would sleep over at my boyfriend's that night. \r\n\r\nHe was actually incredibly apologetic which I appreciated and said he had no idea it was affecting me so badly. Except the thing is: he's still pretty loud after 10.30 into all hours of the night. He's not playing music or anything but yet again, he has friends over loudly chatting (they got here 9.30, still here 11)  and it's a work day tomorrow. He also didn't tell me they were going to come over so I didn't get the chance to organise going over to my boyfriend's. One of the things I got really annoyed about was when I talked to him about it, I tried to empathise and said I'm sure he could hear me all the time as well and it was just a terrible wall. Except he said he actually couldn't hear me pretty much 99% of the time. \r\n\r\nI put a lot of effort into being considerate of noise from my room - I don't have friends over past 10.30 generally ever (sometimes have them over drinking, but we go out clubbing at 10), if I watch TV in the evening/night, I wear my headphones etc. This guy woke me up this morning with his alarm that went over for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSo every time he brings friends around, I start playing music. I'm paranoid of affecting the other housemates however as they're nice people, so I've checked the volume is low enough it doesn't go their side of the house - but I'm assuming he can't be missing it with how thin our wall is. And considering that I can't sleep for hours after his friends go, I've been keeping it on as if my sleep is disrupted, I want to show him the same courtesy. \r\n\r\nBe honest. AITA for doing this? I'm sleep deprived as I write this so definitely could be.\r\n\r\nEdit: playing the music is also because I really want him to understand how thin the wall is, and to know that if he can hear my low volume music this clearly - I can hear him talking right now. Just to clarify!\r\n\r\nEdit2: my house is rented primarily to students so our realtor has extra clauses in our contract, specifically relating to noise between 10pm-6am (hence why I was so careful with my noise, should have clarified). A reason I picked this place was because I did think it would be a great environment as noisy houses would do me in.\r\n\r\nEdit3: this blew up in the few hours I slept! (Joking...) Extra INFO: guy's frequency of having people over 4-5 times a week right now. \r\n\r\nCan't switch rooms, we have separate rental contracts. Noise clauses mentioned before in contract - not sure if they only relate to excessive noise as it just says \"noise between 10pm-6am\". \r\n\r\nHave talked to the guy 3-4 times about it now, one of these times we set up the arrangement to have his friends over less, this is now past that.\r\n\r\nI sent him a message last night as I had to get my boyfriend to pick me at 12 as I couldn't sleep, explaining I had to go and saying it was uncool that he didn't give me a heads up his friends were over so I could go sleep at my boyfriend's earlier than this.\r\n\r\nFINAL UPDATE: called my rental agency and asked about my contract. They said that his actions in having friends over repeatedly between the quiet hours were a breach of contract. The noise clause in our contract is not relating to any and all noise but they did say that social noise between those hours isn't tolerated as it's specifically targeting that. So, doubt my petty actions are going to be continuing as I'd like to stay in NTA zone and I'll just report him in future if he continues (after communicating his breach to him though, I'll obviously give him another shot)."}, "1700": {"id": "cg6jrv", "title": "AITA for stealing my grandfather's dentures after he smashed my glasses?", "body": "I (16M) was visiting my grandparents this past weekend.

Basically, I (18F) was given a bag of receipts and asked to separate the receipts by month to make her job easier. What she does is look at the receipts and enters information from them into Excel and when this is done, she gives the Excel spreadsheet to her friend so his job is easier too. My mom told me that I would get a cut of what she is paid for doing this work. When I asked how much, she said that she didn't know since she had never done this before, and when I asked for an estimate, she said she would probably end up giving me around $100 for my part.\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of receipts and by the time I was done separating, it had been about 12 hours of work. However, I would watch Netflix while I did this so it wasn't strict like a real job. My mom would watch TV sometimes as she did her part.\r\n\r\nI would like to add that my mom doesn't need the money. She said she just wanted extra pocket money. My family goes on out of country month long holidays every year. Money isn't tight.\r\n\r\nAnyways, she had finished her part (for this batch, she can start another batch of receipts if she wants for another payment) and had given it to the guy.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until today when I went shopping after work (I'm a university student and I have a part time job) and spent about $90 on clothes did I ask her about my cut.\r\n\r\nAt this point, she had seen the clothes that I had bought (they were pricey, I only bought 2 items). She goes on to say that she had received payment and that she would give me $50 and then put $50 towards my phone bill.\r\n\r\nThis is where I'm starting to wonder if I was in the wrong because I said no, I want the $100. I had gone on a camping trip the week before and used more data than I usually do so I had texted her that I would pay the difference (the data is a pay as you use). She has never asked me to pay my phone bill before and I am 99% sure this was prompted by my spending.\r\n\r\nShe says no and starts yelling about how I said I would pay her for my data usage. I agree to this but the issue is that it is very unlikely that the data is anywhere near $50. I tell her that I want her to tell me how much I owe in data and that I will pay her that. She continues to say no and that the $50 will go towards future data payments as well. However, I rarely ever go over our agreed limit.\r\n\r\nI ask her how much her friend paid her for the work we did and she refused to answer. She did more work than me (maybe around 2 times the hours) so understandably, she would be paid more, but the fact that she wouldn't even disclose the full amount and then she cuts my amount in half makes me feel like I'm being duped for the late nights I put into that work.

This summer, a good friend of mine (21F) and I (20F) decided to room together in a big city as we both are interning here. We have been friends for a little over a year with no real arguments or issues.\r\n\r\nOver the summer, my roommate has consistently been nagging on me for ways I have slightly annoyed/inconvenienced her: watching something on my phone on at very low volume (two notches up on the iPhone volume), not dumping out the liquid in a cup before throwing it in our trash, waking her (at 11 am) when she could hear me talk to my mom on the phone outside our room (walls are thin I guess), etc. \r\n\r\nShe has never said please when making requests of me or thank you once I said sorry and corrected my behavior, which always irritated me and seemed petty. The last straw was when the lights were off in our room as she was trying to sleep at 10 pm and I was using my phone flashlight to navigate the room as I had just gotten out of the shower. She began loudly sighing (obviously annoyed) and asked me to turn off the light, in which I thought of as a ridiculous request. We argued. I asked her what was I exactly suppose to do, navigate the room in the dark? I told her that she has annoyed me so many times for small things this summer, but I deal with it and don't complain because with a roommate comes being annoyed every now and then and you can't nag at every small thing. She basically stated that that was too bad and I should've said something and been clear and direct with her. I ended the conversation with \"is there anything else I can do for you princess?\". Which was bad..I know. She took her pillow and blanket to the living room where she slept instead.\r\n\r\nThis was two weeks ago. The day after, I attempted to talk to her normally as I didn't think the argument was a big deal. She was very short with me so I stopped and figured if she wanted to be petty, let her. Since then, we haven't spoken a word to each other. Not even a hello when she or I walks into the room. We were such good friends before and I think it is unbelievably childish of her to continue to ignore me and be this upset about a relatively dumb argument. She is, however, a pretty sensitive person who becomes easily defensive and can't take criticism super well imo.\r\n\r\nThe only two times I nagged on her was 1) When I jokingly complained about it always being cold in our room whenever she turns the temperature down further below my liking, which she became very defensive about and 2) When she came back from a night out at 3 am slamming drawers which woke me up, which she also was very quick and snappy about (\"Well I literally just got home\"...?? She was definitely drunk though).\r\n\r\nI don't want to apologize because I don't really feel like I have done anything bad. She was simply being a whiny princess and I called her out on it...right?

She said, \"I don't know, but maybe you and Lana do.\" Then I realized I had left my desktop on, so she was able to see all my imessage conversations. Why she snooped, I don't know.

About 6 years ago I started getting interested in D&D. I found a group of girls online in my city and started playing, kind of enjoyed it but wasn't really feeling the group. A few weeks later I discovered that my best friend was also getting interested in D&D, and I was ecstatic. I asked her immediately if she wanted to join the raid I was already in, or better yet we'd find our own clan but bottom line I was super excited to share this pretty niche interest with someone I was so close to. TBH our friendship had become more of a \"We've been friends forever but don't really have much in common\" bond, so I was thrilled to have a thing in common again, I thought it would reignite our bond.   \r\nNOPE.   \r\nShe barely acknowledged my interest. She ignored my requests, always changing the subject, always ignoring messages I'd send about meetups. That lasted about a month and I took the hint - she was playing with her roommate and his friends and that was that, and I dropped it.  April not inviting me to things she did with her other friends has always been a thing, but I always chalked it up to her keeping church and state separate, and that's been okay with me. Our friendship carried on just fine, we just never mentioned D&D to each other again. \r\n\r\nOur lives changed dramatically through the years - I began dating an awesome guy with a huge circle of friends and have a really full social calendar. April broke up with her boyfriend and has been single for 5 years and complains constantly about having nothing to do.

She's been dropping hints that she wants to \"get back into D&D\" since she saw the post, and is looking for a group. I have summarily ignored the request. For \"D&D\" you need 8 people, and my boyfriend keeps asking if I'm going to ask April as she'd be the eighth member. Last night I got a little short with him when he asked again, telling him I thought I'd made my opinion on asking her pretty clear. He apologized and said he'd drop it, but, now I'm wondering - am I being an asshole here not inviting her? She's lonely and complains about having no social life and would really enjoy this. But on the other hand, she excluded me and now that I'm the one with the group she's banging at my door.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: WIBTA if I excluded my best friend from D&D just because she excluded me from it years ago?"}, "1707": {"id": "chboxw", "title": "AITA for not wanting to share my ice cream with my boyfriend", "body": "Despite this title seeming really petty over ice cream, hear me out.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) have been together for 10 months, and have been living together for 7.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nI wanted to address how I felt frustrated about him expecting to share my ice cream with him even though he said he didn't want any when I asked him before I bought it. The first time I bought ice cream, I did offer to share it with him since in the past he's called me selfish and petty for not wanting to share my food with him. However, when the ice cream ran out and I bought more, I asked if he wanted any yet again, and he still said no, so we didn't split the cost of it and it was supposed to be just for me.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nLast weekend he brought cherries home and wanted to share some while we watched TV. I wanted ice cream instead, so I grabbed an ice cream bar for myself and sat down, waiting for him to say something. He didn't say anything so I started eating it, and then he asked if he could have a bite. He ended up taking two large bites and left me with half my ice cream. I was really upset and I told him that it was frustrating that he kept eating my ice cream, even though he said he didn't want any before, but expects me to share it with him.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe got mad at me for being frustrated, and said I was petty for not wanting to share food with him, and that he buys me food and other things all the time and doesn't ask me to split the costs. The thing is, we split the cost for groceries and eating out, and I do buy food for him all the time when I'm out and think he might like something. He also gets me food on occasion but it's never an expectation. He also brought up how he never asks me to pay for the Roomba filters and special garbage bags (he had before moving in) and how I am unappreciative of them, even though it was him who insisted on these more expensive things and I repeatedly told him I didn't want them. I had a perfectly fine vacuum and garbage bin, but he insisted on having those things and agreed to pay for them.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nIn general, he thinks he provides and betters my life so much that I shouldn't be so petty over ice cream, and that I keep looking at the small things instead of the bigger picture.

She has decided to finally cut down on certain junk foods she eats.

So I pretty much yelled back \"At least I'm doing something unlike a certain someone who still eats junk food every second she has the chance!\" and she just got pissed and walked to her room and shut the door. \r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA?\r\n\r\nTl;dr: Sister told me that I can't comment on her weight since I'm still fat even though I've actually put the work in to start losing it while she hasn't.

However, her friend moved to LA, so my SO thinks its a good idea to invite her and her SO over.\r\n\r\n\r\nI told my SO that I would prefer getting dinner with her friend and SO separately, at my SO's place, or at some restaurant. I don't get to see my cousin very often, and after my SO moves back to Philadelphia when her work obligations are completed, my cousin and I will meet even less frequently. Adding people that none of us really know well I think may make the night less fun in my opinion, and more \"formal,\" rather than \"loose.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nMy SO was upset with that idea, and said that inviting people over multiple nights will be a lot of work, and told me that I am being \"weird\" and \"antisocial.\" I said that I would be happy to prepare the food if we do it at her place (I generally do anyway when we call people over), and we all help with cleanup, which takes no time at all. If we went to a restaurant instead, I would be happy to pay for our meals. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe tells me that it is not about that, and states that \"we never hang out with my friends and do what I want.\" I pointed out to her that the past two times I visited, we have met her friends for dinner in LA (though we have separately also invited my cousin over for dinner those times as well), and that I plan on continuing to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe didn't like that answer, and basically told me that if we are going to invite my cousin over, then she is inviting her friend and her friend's SO over, because its \"her place, so she gets to make the final call.\" If I didn't agree to that plan, then she said I am free to go hang out with my cousin alone at my cousin's place. I think she is being unreasonable and childish here, but I may be wrong as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA?\r\n\r\n"}, "1715": {"id": "cjxu5i", "title": "AITA for not giving my wife (with 6 month old twins) a full 10 hours of sleep?", "body": "Wifey (25F) and I (24F) have been struggling with \u201ckeeping score\u201d with our parenting lately.

Another friend commented that maybe now I could visit her this summer because I wouldn't need a catsitter anymore. Another friend thought it was a good time to share that she never cared for my cat.

I was cool at the beginning cause I knew she was trying to get back on her feet but after this happening few times(relapse and go back into hospital) I gave up because the relationship was only one sided. She never listened to my problems or anything from me anymore. If she did listen she didn't care and would only reach out when she was sad or had any drama in her life. She was always telling me about people being bad to her and all the conflict she had.

I (29F) have been divorced since Feb of 2018. We had been together for 8 years. My divorce was the result of my ex-husband(34M) having a 6 months long, long distance affair with a girl(24F) he met online playing video games. We have two small children. The end of the relationship (after I found out about the affair and it continued because they are shits) leading up to the divorce and separation was messy and I suffered a lot. My ex-husband was a shit to me.\r\n\r\nWhile I was married, we would often go to family gatherings on my husband\u2019s side and he has several cousins around his age. The cousin he was the closest with(31M) was also married and his wife(34F) became close with me. She told me a lot of personal things, including that she had had occasionally cheated on her husband.  I kept those secrets to myself, not even telling my husband. The way I saw it, that knowledge was not my bomb to drop. I didn\u2019t want to cause pain for anyone. If I had said something, I would have been scolded and ridiculed by the rest of my husband\u2019s family for bringing an issue like that to light. I guess I just hoped that she would come to her senses one day and stop\u2026 or be caught. \r\n\r\nRewind  to 3 weeks ago, I get a face time call from this friend/cousin and when I pick up she looks terrible. I ask if everything is ok and she says no, and that her husband has found out about all of her affairs, that she is a compulsive liar, that she\u2019s lied to everyone about a lot of things for her whole life and that she\u2019s probably even lied to me about things. Then she said that her husband asked if anyone knew about her cheating, and she told her husband that I knew. She was just calling me to let me know that he might be calling me and that whatever he asked; I could tell the truth about it. I expected he might call me within a couple days, but then kinda put it out of my mind.\r\n\r\nFast forward to yesterday when I get a text message from the guy that basically said that I\u2019m a piece of shit for not telling him because I was supposed to be family (even though I was just as much family with her and she and I were closer than he and I ever were).  He said had I told him years ago that he could have left her when they only had one kid, and now they have 3, and that I could have saved them a lot of trouble had I been a stand up person and spoke about it.

It was like they didn't want their broken car parked in front of their house, but it was alright to take up a spot next to ours.\r\n\r\nWhen my mom got home from work today I told her that I had reported the car in which she completely blew up at me for. She claims that by reporting the neighbors car, I'll be causing issues and creating drama. Even though reporting things like this is completely anonymous, she says that they'll know I'm the one who reported it and I should have never said anything in the first place. She also says that they're good neighbors and they haven't done anything to us to deserve this (even though they let their dog roam the neighborhood unattended and poop on everyone's lawn).

I've babysat her kids multiples times before whenever she asks so she can work her part-time job during the weekends, usually between 5 a.m.-1p.m. This would've been no different except she's been sick (cold/fever) for a couple of days.\r\n\r\nI'm 29(M) shes's 29(F) and has 2 great kids, boy (7) and girl (5). We've know each other for almost 5 years, met at a part time job we were both working at right after she split up with their dad and we've been on and off since. She's a full time single mom with 2 jobs. I work 1 job M-F 44-50 hr weeks. The kids' dad isn't really around much, maybe twice a month when their son needs a haircut. Whenever she asks him to watch them, he'll reply late, when she's asleep, the next day or not reply at all so he isn't reliable. I see them more than he does. She has talked about a relationship but I'm too afraid to commit. Whenever she's financially struggling and needs help, I let her borrow whatever she needs and half the time I tell her not to worry about paying me back, you know, for the kids.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday she sent a text, asking if I was spending the night or showing up in the morning (4a.m.) to watch the kids. I had a long day at work so didn't get off till 7p.m. I text her as soon as I got off (phones are not allowed at work, she knows) I had just gotten off and was headed home, 35-40 min drive. Anyway, asked when was I coming over and I told her I wasn't sure since I was still headed home. Well she said if I couldn't make it by 9 p.m. to not worry about it since that's when she was going to sleep and wasn't going to wake up to let me in. Now it also takes about 30 mins to her place from mines, so I wouldn't have much time home before heading out to make it by 9. There was no way I was going to wake up at 3:30 a.m to babysit; it was Friday, it was a long week and I am working Saturday/Sunday for 2x OT. So I asked her if she could at least wait till 9:30, so I can shower, eat something, read some e-mails, get ready to spend the night, just basic things. *Again*, she said don't worry about it. \r\n\r\nNow this is where there was a disagreement. I asked her if couldn't make it in time, who would watch them, to her replying with \"*no one, I just won't make it then*.\" So I asked, \"*well since apparently you aren't working at 5a.m anymore, why do you still need to go to bed at 9*\"?, to her replying with, \"*why would I stay up late*\"? I replied with, \"*you aren't going to work if I can't make it by 9 so you basically don't have to wake up at 4*\", to her saying, \"*And*?\". I didn't reply. It irritated me and I don't want her kids in that situation(her being short on cash). \r\n\r\nWe still haven't spoken and I felt bad that she had to miss Saturday, but I still feel she was being ridiculous for not waiting.

Every time I tried messaging or attempted to pick up the phone, it would cripple me and produce panic attacks. I hope this makes more sense. I also did not mention the fact that when we were talking, I was asking her how things are with her (school, boyfriend, family, general life stuff). Again, sorry I forgot to mention this.**\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2: Few people mentioned this so I'll also add that I did not follow up after leaving the restaurant, because the anxiety convinced me that I just ruined a friendship and that I was worthless and should not waste any more of her time.

She stopped asking me to do any thing or join her in stuff and we were at an event for a few weeks after and she ignored me. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sally and I remained friends, but we had a disagreement about something else around the same time. Later, Sally apologized and I accepted, and she suggested we meet up to talk it out. I agreed, day of she says she can\u2019t go and has something come up. I tell her when I\u2019m available again and ask her to reschedule, and tell her my availability, she never tells me her schedule. That was maybe 2 months ago. We haven\u2019t talked since. \r\n\r\nToday, after 3 months of not talking to Beth, I noticed she unfollowed me on both of my IG accounts. I posted a vent this morning on one account about a bad workout and said \u201cif you don\u2019t like to read it, unfollow me if you want hahaha\u201d with a laughing emoji and she appears to take this quite literally, which I never expected. She took the time to unfollow me on both of my accounts. I don\u2019t care about IG followers, I care she hates me so much she took the time to do that and what the unfollowing represents. \r\n\r\nI have pretty much accepted these girls are our of my life and they aren\u2019t interested in being my friend for whatever reason, but it hurts my feelings that people have honestly just stopped talking to me for no reason. I don\u2019t want to reach out to them or figure it out, and I know all friendships don\u2019t last forever but this hurts. \r\n\r\nSo AITA and at fault for these friendships ending?"}, "1753": {"id": "cuvaeq", "title": "AITA for eating all the sliced cheese?", "body": "Sliced cheese is a favourite snack and breakfast food for my sister (21F) and I (20F).\r\n\r\nYesterday the sliced cheese that we had at home got over. I ate the last slice. When I got home in the evening my sister accused me of eating her share of the sliced cheese. Apparently for the past two weeks she hasn't been eating breakfast at home (I didn't know this because I leave the house before her every day) and so I ended up eating more than my share of the packet.\r\n\r\nShe said that for each packet we buy, half of the slices belong to her and half belong to me. I disagreed, having always seen the cheese as a replenishable good that didn't necessarily belong half to me and half to her. She said it wasn't fair to her because now that she wanted to snack on sliced cheese, she'd have to wait until our next grocery run.\r\n\r\nEventually I backed down and went to buy some more sliced cheese, and agreed to divide the packet into two so I'd only eat from my pile. Still feels a bit ridiculous to me though. AITA?\r\n\r\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments guys! I agree that this is definitely one of the pettiest things to argue over. Just to clear some things up: We're both full-time students with part-time jobs and pay rent. That being said we pool resources for both shared and personal expenses. In India that's pretty common.

And because I'm the main link between the two of them, for the last two months a frequent subject of discussion with Sarah is \"Oh OP, I just want Sawyer to like me! Has he said anything to you? I don't even want to be super close with him, I just want us to be friends! Why doesn't he like me?\" I usually just went the \"I'm sorry Sarah, I don't know what to tell you because I can't really share how he feels and I can't force him to tell you. I think you just have to roll with it\" route.\r\n\r\nBut yesterday, I was having a really bad day.

Can you just put your ego aside for a second and understand that you can't always get what you want? You have plenty of friends, shit, you even have a boyfriend who loves you!

My partner(32F)  of 5 years and her family planned a trip away for a few days during the week (this was only planned a week or so ago). This normally wouldn't have been an issue except as I've started a new job I couldn't come. Anyway, most people here get Monday off work. I couldn't fathom why when they knew I couldn't attend they wouldn't schedule it for the long weekend.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so the day comes my partner goes and all is fine. I never would have expected everyone to reschedule for me, I really wouldn't. My issue is that I just would like to have been asked, I would have said no but still would like to have been asked but everyone went and ive seen all the activities just plastered all over social media the past few days and the mrs has been very quiet (understandable as she has been busy).\r\n\r\nIts eating at me a little, as in the past similar things have happened. To give you context. My mrs has a sister who has a partner. I honestly feel things aren't very fair. For example, if her partner couldn't come (frequently happens as he is very sporty and plays a lot of matches) things are called off or are just plain not arranged when he is playing. Similarly as he works in schools, nothing is ever planned on those days, or his match days yet when I was busy, no problem it was booked and was all fine.\r\n\r\nI asked my partner why it wasn't offered to be rescheduled. Id never have let them but this is often done when other people involved are occupied. This escalated to her saying \"Do you think everyone should just rearrange for you?\" \"We had it planned and then other people tagged along\" \"You could've taken the time off\".... this set a bit of a bad tone for the rest of the evening, When things get heated I know people can tend to not be rational, as a result I took my iPad and went to go sit in a separate room to let things cool down. To which she said \"Oh that's right just walk away like you always do, go sit on your own like you always do\" (I do do this all the time, if we're arguing, what's the point of two heated adults arguing, why not let it cool down)..... now this wasn't my finest move after but I retaliated with \"well you'd know all about me being on my own after everyone fucked off without me on your mini holiday\".... to which she responded with \"oh you're just jealous\"..... This totally isn't the case... I get Im the ass hole for retaliating and saying that, there was no way I could have gone regardless with my new job, It would just have been nice to have been asked if I wanted them to rearrange.\r\n\r\nAITH here? I just thought it would have been nice to have been asked to rearrange considering I was the only person in the family who couldn't go? Its not like I had better plans. I had a job I had just started. And this situation has happened before with other parties and the whole thing has been called off.

It started when my MIL went against her boss/landlord for breaking many labor laws including withholding her vacation pay, and not giving her any vacation time, while cutting her hours in half. She involved the labor board, which resulted in him evicting her, and her 3 kids that still lived with her. Her kids are a 10 year old girl, 12 year old boy, and 17 year old boy. It started with \"can the boys stay with you for the weekend?\" To which my husband (22m), and I (22f), said yes. Then a weekend turned into a few days, which turned into a week, which turned into indefinitely (I was not part of the indefinitely conversation) after two months an apartment opened up in our building, and she took it. The 17 year old still stays with us for our internet, and has an extreme x-box addiction. He plays from the time he wakes up to the time he goes to sleep\r\n\r\nToday, when I left in the afternoon to take my husband to work, I noticed that my BIL wasn't here, so I locked the door. Within about 20 minutes, he's texting me asking why the door was locked. I said that I didn't know when I would be back, so I locked it. When I got home about an hour later, I went inside, and locked the door. Within ten minutes, he was knocking at the door. I didn't answer. He texted asking if I was home, I never answered. About 10pm, he's at the door again, this time I answered and let him in becuase I was leaving to go pick up my husband from work soon anyways. \r\n\r\nBasically, I saw an opportunity to be kid-free in my own home for a few hours, and took it. When I told my husband what I did he was annoyed. He said that I shouldn't have locked him out, becuase I agreed that he could visit, and the fact that I locked him out for a few hours makes me an asshole. I agreed to visits, but the kid has not slept one night at his mom's house since she moved in. \r\n\r\nAITA for seizing the opportunity to be kid-free for a few hours?\r\n\r\nEdit: should have noted that the kid has a bad temper, and I'm scared of dealing with it alone.

We got towards the end of the game and my girlfriend's team was winning by 2 runs and she was on first base and as I looked over she was walking further and further away from her base while the bowler had the ball at the square, therefore cheating.

The friend seemed happy to visit, but sometimes it seemed like his happiness was a bit fake - huge smiles for the selfies, but little to no laughter or otherwise. My partner said they spoke about some things in the friend's past, but  my partner thought his friend was doing OK.

His friend left our home, I again strongly, very strongly, tried to bring my partner's attention to his friend and tried to stress the importance of my partner at least explicitly asking whether his friend had overcome his past difficulties or not, but again, for the second or third time, my partner refused.\r\n\r\nI then did something I have never done before. I contacted my partner's friend and asked him myself if he was doing alright before and during our visit. I explained to him what and why I was asking him, I explained that my partner did not know about me contacting him (implying that I was acting out of concern, but that ultimately, my partner was not at fault if the friend would get angry), and I basically asked him to forgive me intruding in his private matters, but that I found it to be important to ask him to get a peace of mind. \r\n\r\nThe friend answered, said that he had experienced troubles in the past several years, but that things were on their way up again; thanked me for asking and essentially, all was well.\r\n\r\nWe saw this friend again this summer.
